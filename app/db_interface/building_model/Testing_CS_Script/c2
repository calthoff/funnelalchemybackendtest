From being selected to ring the bell at Nasdaq and showcase our story in Times Square, to being honored during Christmas at the Library of Congress, we have elevated our visibility and impact. \n\nWe continued to grow our fundraising capacity which serves our mission and members, deepening our programmatic efforts and increasing our scholarship relief. \n\nOur chapter, regional and national board members served our members with distinction, together with their advisors and the dedicated staff at World Headquarters. NSBE has remained steadfast through uncertain times, proving once again that our Society’s foundation is unshakeable.\n\nAugust 1st begins our new fiscal year, and I am excited to continue this great work.

Being surrounded by thousands of Black engineers, all driven by innovation, excellence, and community, reminded me why NSBE is such a powerful organization.\n\nI had the chance to connect with recruiters and industry professionals at the Career Fair, exploring exciting opportunities in engineering and technology. Attending insightful workshops on leadership, technical development, and career growth gave me valuable skills and knowledge to apply in my own journey. Beyond that, I engaged with NSBE members from across the country, forming meaningful connections that extend far beyond this event. Outside of the conference, I also had the chance to explore the dynamic city of Chicago, immersing myself in its rich culture, iconic architecture, and renowned culinary scene—an enriching experience that complemented the overall event.\n\nEvery time I attend NSBE Nationals, I leave feeling even more inspired and driven to advance in my career. The energy, support, and opportunities that come with being part of this incredible community are unmatched.
