He would always say this about large projects: \u201cthe big bang approach will fail, you need to divide and conquer\u201d.\nAlso a great engineering leader, Tarek is particularly very good at getting new team members up to speed with the overall dynamics of the project and engage effectively with the project stakeholders.

With four mainline certifications and 19 micro certs, as well as having security clearances to work on federal government and DOD projects, he is truly a pro who can go anywhere and do anything with ServiceNow. I first worked with Abdul in early 2020, when he joined a small innovation team which I was leading. We were exploring how ServiceNow could be leveraged to accelerate value realization during enterprise migrations to the cloud. I requested Abdul join the team because of his expertise in managing CMDB, ITOM Discovery and cloud integration with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, which he excels at.\n\nAbdul tackled these tasks easily, while creating new integrations to several key cloud APIs, but that was just the start. While interviewing various cloud practitioners at Atos and among our customers, he identified and implemented many other use cases for our MVP where Tag Governance, HR and Cloud Configuration workflows could be automated to speed migrations to the cloud. His forward-thinking partnership with our cloud practice and the ServiceNow ITOM Business Unit  contributed greatly to the release in March 2022 of ServiceNow's ITOM Cloud Governance product in the ServiceNow store. I truly believe there are few people outside of ServiceNow who have had such a large impact on our product roadmap in such a short time.\n \nI am very pleased to give Abdul a high reference not just because of his broad technical skill, but due to his thoughtful and easy demeanor and his constant focus on customer outcomes. In addition to being a great technical leader, Abdul also is a respected mentor to many of the early-career staff he works with, both at Atos and with customers. There is a worldwide shortage of ServiceNow talent, and I appreciate that while he continuously improves his own skills, Abdul always works to uplift the talents of his team mates as well.\u201d",

My journey in finance is driven by a deep curiosity and a passion for understanding the intricacies of financial markets and data analysis. I have continuously worked diligently to gain certifications and practical knowledge that reflect my commitment and character. During my time at Loyola, I participated in the selective Job Shadowing Program, which provided me with invaluable insights into areas such as Enterprise Credit, Global Commercial Banking, Rates &amp; Currencies, and Global Payments Solutions. This experience, combined with my coursework, has given me a solid foundation in financial principles and practices. I am also currently preparing to take the CFA Level I exam as part of my commitment to advancing my expertise in finance. I have received a scholarship for the exam and I am excited to develop further my skills in portfolio management, financial analysis, and risk management. To further bolster my expertise, I have earned the Bloomberg Market Concepts (BMC) certification and developed proficiency in tools like Microsoft Excel, R Studio, and the Bloomberg Terminal. My role as a receptionist at VIBEZ Fit has also allowed me to manage financial transactions, process billing, and enhance customer experiences, ensuring accurate and efficient handling of member payments. In addition to my academic and professional experiences, I have taken on leadership roles, such as the Director of Marketing for the International Business Society, where I successfully promoted the organization's brand and mission.

    "summary": "Hello! My journey began with a life-changing moment. As a result of a serious motorcycle accident, I had a long recovery period. During this time, I developed an interest in software engineering out of boredom and curiosity. In the first few months, coding quickly became a passion. I taught myself and soon became fascinated by it. After extensive research, I discovered programming bootcamps. Despite initial skepticism, I decided to turn this newfound interest into a career. After leaving Pittsburgh, I attended a renowned bootcamp in Denver, Colorado, learning Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. I knew mastering these languages would open countless opportunities for me in software development. The journey didn't end there. I moved to Seattle, a city filled with innovation and technological advancements, to fully immerse myself in the tech world. Here, I continue to grow and thrive as a developer. My notetaking app, inspired by Quiver, won a Microsoft hackathon and I've presented at Microsoft Build twice, serving as an example for women in tech. It has taught me to approach problems from the end user's perspective, and consider how my code will impact their experience. Outside of work, I embrace challenges fearlessly. I love scuba diving and recently learned to hang glide. I also foster huskies through a husky rescue, embracing their chaos. I'm always looking to grow my personal and professional network.

While I am well versed in nutrition science, I am not an experienced marketer.  Over the past year, Hana has taken me under her wing, taught me a lot about marketing, and everything I now know about affiliate marketing.  Like a true health coach, Hana was patient, motivating, and supportive.  Even though we work for different companies, with different goals, it always felt like we were on the same team.  Crazy to think we formed such an awesome working relationship 3 time zones apart, using nothing but Microsoft teams, and our cell phones.
