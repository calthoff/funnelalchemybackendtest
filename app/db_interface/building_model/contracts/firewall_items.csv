GROUPS MOST IMPACTED INCLUDED MEN (83% OF NEW HIV DIAGNOSES); GAY, BISEXUAL, AND OTHER MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM) (76%); NON-HISPANIC BLACKS (54%); AND INDIVIDUALS AGED 20-29 YEARS OLD (43%). NEW HIV INFECTIONS WERE CLUSTERED IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITY AREAS ON THE NORTH, SOUTH, AND WEST SIDES OF THE CITY. BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010, THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL PERCENT DECREASE IN NEW HIV DIAGNOSES WAS 6.2%, REPRESENTING A 50% REDUCTION IN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF NEW DIAGNOSES (1850 TO 991). BETWEEN 2011 AND 2015, THE PERCENT CHANGE OF DECREASE SLOWED TO 2.8%, REPRESENTING A 7% REDUCTION IN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF NEW DIAGNOSES (991 TO 921).  OF THE 23,355 CHICAGOANS LIVING WITH HIV IN 2015, ONLY 40% WERE RETAINED IN CARE, AND 48% PERCENT WERE VIRALLY SUPPRESSED. WHILE POPULATION-LEVEL DATA ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE ESTIMATE THAT 10% OF VULNERABLE HIV-NEGATIVE INDIVIDUALS ARE USING PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP).  PROGRAM OUTCOMESTHROUGH OUR INTEGRATED HIV PREVENTION AND SURVEILLANCE STRATEGIES OUTLINED IN OUR PROPOSAL, OVER THE COURSE OF THIS FIVE-YEAR COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT, THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (CDPH) WILL MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING ITS PRIORITY OUTCOMES. BY 2022, CDPH EXPECTS TO INCREASE BY 10% THE NUMBER OF PLWH WHO ARE VIRALLY SUPPRESSED AND 10% THE NUMBER OF VULNERABLE HIV NEGATIVE INDIVIDUAL WHO USE PREP. THE HIV/STI BUREAU?S HIV SERVICES PORTFOLIO CREATES AN OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT FOR ACHIEVING THE SHORT, INTERMEDIATE, AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES IDENTIFIED IN THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT.THROUGH OUR PROPOSED DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, CDPH WILL ADAPT AND IMPLEMENT A DATA SHARING TOOL (KNOWN AD HIV DATA ENCLAVE) TO IMPROVE COORDINATION WITHIN CDPH HIV/STI PROGRAMS, AND BETWEEN ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (IDPH) AND CDPH TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF PREVENTION AND CARE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO CROSS JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES. THE HIV DATA ENCLAVE APPLICATION WILL BUILD UPON THE ?BLACK BOX? CONCEPT WITH SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS AND APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING: (I) SECURE HOSTING AND AUTOMATED DATA FEEDS WITHIN HEALTH DEPARTMENT FIREWALLS; (II) A COMBINED HIV SURVEILLANCE AND HIV PROGRAM DATA CENTER TO FACILITATE CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL PREVENTION AND CARE COORDINATION; (III) AUTOMATED DATA FEEDBACK TO INITIAL DATA SOURCES TO UPDATE SURVEILLANCE DATA WITH CURRENT CLIENT INFORMATION AND CARE STATUS; AND (IV) GENERATION OF ROUTINE AUTOMATED REPORTS, LINE LISTINGS OF PEOPLE NOT IN CARE, AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA TABLES/GRAPHS TO INCREASE DATA DISSEMINATION AND PROGRAM MONITORING.",https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NU62PS924560_075/

HIGH-RISK HPV (HRHPV) IS A MAJOR TRANSMISSIBLE CAUSE OF CANCERS OF THE ANUS AND OROPHARYNX IN SEXUAL MINORITY MEN (SMM). PREVALENCE OF HRHPV IN SMM IN TANZANIA, EAST AFRICA, A LMIC, IS HIGH AND PROBABLY EPIDEMIC IN ITS LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREA, DAR ES SALAAM. WE PROPOSE TO REPLICATE OUR STUDY TO INVITE AND TRAIN TANZANIAN SMM TO TAKE “SELFIES” OF THE OROPHARYNX AT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH RESOLUTION TO OBSERVE POTENTIAL EARLY LESIONS THAT MAY BE MALIGNANT. THESE “SELFIES” ARE RATED BY AN EXPERT ON OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER FOR SUFFICIENT CLARITY TO DETECT EARLY LESIONS. A GROUP OF 100 SMM WILL BE RECRUITED BY BOTH INTERNET AND RDS SEEDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY, AND ALSO OFFERED A FULL COURSE OF HRHPV VACCINATION. AN INITIAL QUESTIONNAIRE ON KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND SEXUAL PRACTICES WILL BE COMPLETED ON INTERNET AND PARTICIPANTS TRAINED AT A LOCAL NGO TO TAKE ORAL “SELFIES” WHICH ARE UPLOADED TO A FIREWALLED INTERNET SITE FOR AN ENT SPECIALIST TO ASSESS CLARITY. AFTER ENROLLMENT, TWO FURTHER VISITS WILL BE SCHEDULED AT 2 AND 6 MONTHS FOR VACCINATION SHOTS, AND TO ASSESS RETENTION FOR A FUTURE COHORT STUDY. DATA ON KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, SEXUAL RISK PRACTICES, ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF SCREENING FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER, AND HRHPV VACCINATION, IN THIS POPULATION AND SETTING WILL BE ASSESSED.",https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01CA253244_075/
ASST_NON_R21NS121745_075,unknown,"THE RETROSPLENIAL GATE HYPOTHESIS FOR ANTERIOR THALAMIC STIMULATION IN TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION OF THE ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SEIZURES IN PATIENTS WITH INTRACTABLE TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY, BUT RARELY LEADS TO COMPLETE REMISSION. THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION UNDERLYING THESE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS REMAIN UNKNOWN. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A SPECIFIC PATHWAY BY WHICH ANTERIOR THALAMIC STIMULATION MAY INDUCE AN INHIBITORY FIREWALL IN A BRAIN REGION CALLED THE RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX, POTENTIALLY PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF SEIZURES. THE HIPPOCAMPAL FORMATION SENDS DENSE OUTPUTS TO THE SUPERFICIAL LAYERS OF THE RETROSPLENIAL GRANULAR CORTEX (RSG) VIA THE SUBICULUM. ANTERIOR THALAMIC AXONS CONVERGE ONTO EXACTLY THE SAME RSG CIRCUIT. THE RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX THEN PROJECTS TO DOZENS OF NEOCORTICAL REGIONS, INCLUDING THE SECONDARY MOTOR CORTEX, AND IS THUS A CRITICAL GATEWAY VIA WHICH SEIZURES CAN SPREAD FROM THE HIPPOCAMPUS TO THE NEOCORTEX, LEADING TO SECONDARILY GENERALIZED MOTOR SEIZURES. DESPITE THIS IMPORTANT CONNECTIVITY, THE CELLS AND CIRCUITS OF THE RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX ARE MASSIVELY UNDERSTUDIED IN EPILEPSY. WE HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW CELL TYPE IN THE RSG AND FOUND THAT THIS BRAIN REGION IS DOMINATED BY LOCAL INHIBITION. OUR RECORDINGS SHOW THAT ANTERIOR THALAMIC INPUTS TO THE RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX STRONGLY RECRUIT THIS INHIBITORY CIRCUITRY AND IDENTIFY A UNIQUE PATHWAY FOR THE THALAMIC RECRUITMENT OF FAST-SPIKING INHIBITORY NEURONS IN RSG, VIA BOTH LAYER 1 AND LAYER 3. THIS PRONOUNCED INHIBITION CAN SILENCE THE EXCITATORY NEURONS OF THE RSG, POTENTIALLY PREVENTING THE PROPAGATION OF SEIZURE ACTIVITY TO THE REST OF THE NEOCORTEX. OUR RETROSPLENIAL GATE HYPOTHESIS POSITS THAT THE INHIBITION-DOMINATED RETROSPLENIAL CIRCUITRY RECRUITED BY ANTERIOR THALAMIC STIMULATION CAN PREVENT THE SPREAD OF TEMPORAL LOBE SEIZURES TO THE NEOCORTEX AND PARTIALLY EXPLAIN THE THERAPEUTIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ANTERIOR THALAMIC DBS. IN AIM 1 WE WILL CHARACTERIZE SIMULTANEOUS NEURONAL DYNAMICS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS, RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX, SECONDARY MOTOR CORTEX AND ANTERIOR THALAMUS IN A RODENT MODEL OF CHRONIC TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY. IN AIM 2, WE WILL CAUSALLY TEST THE RETROSPLENIAL GATE HYPOTHESIS BY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF TEMPORAL LOBE SEIZURES TO THE NEOCORTEX USING THE CLOSED- LOOP OPTOGENETIC STIMULATION OF ANTERIOR THALAMIC PROJECTIONS SPECIFICALLY TO THE RETOSPLENIAL CORTEX. THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS WILL BE COMPARED TO OPTOGENETIC STIMULATION OF ANTERIOR THALAMIC PROJECTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE CORTICAL REGIONS. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY A NOVEL, PRECISE AND RATIONAL THERAPEUTIC PATHWAY FOR THE TREATMENT OF TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY.",https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R21NS121745_075/
