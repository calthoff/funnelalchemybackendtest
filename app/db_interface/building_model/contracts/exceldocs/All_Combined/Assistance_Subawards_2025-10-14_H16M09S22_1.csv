Acute bronchiolitis is a common lung disease of young children caused by respiratory viral infection. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis who are not receiving supplemental oxygen is an overused intervention that has persisted despite evidence that it is ineffective in this population and may cause harm. Three national guidelines now discourage continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis who are not receiving supplemental oxygen. In preliminary studies, the investigators showed that continuous pulse oximetry overuse occurs in nearly half of all hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis for whom there is no monitoring indication, and there is high between-hospital variability in overuse. The overarching goal of the applicants is to determine which strategies are most effective for deimplementing overused health interventions that have the potential to harm children. The overall objective of this application is to conduct the Eliminating Monitor Overuse (EMO) SpO2 trial, a hybrid type III effectiveness-deimplementation trial with a longitudinal cluster-randomized design in 32 Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings Network hospitals. The trial will test an unlearning deimplementation strategy (educational outreach with audit & feedback) vs. a combined unlearning + substitution deimplementation strategy (adding an electronic health record-integrated clinical pathway) on sustainability of continuous pulse oximetry monitoring deimplementation in children with bronchiolitis who are not receiving supplemental oxygen. This proposal includes three Specific Aims: (1) Compare the effects of the unlearning only strategy versus the unlearning + substitution strategy on deimplementation outcomes, (2) Identify deimplementation strategy mechanisms linked to penetration and sustainability using mixed methods, and (3) Examine the effects of deimplementation on clinical outcomes and unintended consequences. This approach is innovative because it focuses on the under-researched area of pediatric deimplementation, the experimental design reflects state-of-the-art theoretical framing of deimplementation interventions, and the primary outcome focuses on long-term sustainability of deimplementation, which is highly relevant to the public. The proposed research is significant because it will advance the science of health care delivery for a high incidence pediatric lung disease that hospitalizes 100,000 children annually, acute viral bronchiolitis. The trial will also provide new insights into the processes, mechanisms, costs, and outcomes of large, rigorously- designed deimplementation efforts.",93.837: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES RESEARCH,sub-grant,23074674-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,1,FP00033315_SUB55_01,401697.00,2022-12-15,2023,GM1XX56LEP58,042250712,"TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, THE",CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA FOUNDATION,GM1XX56LEP58,042250712,"TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, THE",USA,United States,3451 WALNUT ST STE 440A,PHILADELPHIA,PA,PENNSYLVANIA,191046205,PA-03,PA-03,,"PRIVATE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE,HOSPITAL,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION",PHILADELPHIA,PA,PENNSYLVANIA,191046205.0,PA-03,PA-03,USA,United States,"WORK SCOPE DETAILS: THE DETAIL OF THE ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED BY CRCU STAFF IS LISTED BELOW.

I.         INTEGRATION OF CASA DATA INTO FORT WORTH WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE (FWD-
WFO) VIA AWIPS, AWIPS2
THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INTEGRATE CASA HIGH-RESOLUTION PRODUCTS/DATA-STREAMS INTO NWS PLATFORMS TO ENABLE EVALUATION OF CASA DATA BY WFO AND RFC FORECASTERS IN THEIR CURRENT OPERATING AND DECISION-MAKING ENVIRONMENT. CASA SYSTEMS PRODUCE AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA COMPARED TO THE CURRENT DAY WSR-880 BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY AND THEREFORE CAN
SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR HOW HIGH RESOLUTION DATA STREAMS SHOULD BE HANDLED. TASKS INCLUDE:
1. INTEGRATION OF FOLLOWING PRODUCTS INTO AWIPS FOR USE IN THE FWD FORECAST OFFICE IN
2013: SINGLE RADAR VELOCITY, SINGLE RADAR REFLECTIVITY, MERGED COMPOSITE REFLECTIVITY;
COMPOSITE QPE.
A.   CONVERT CASA QPE INTO FONNAT THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH AWIPS

LL.       DATA FUSION, CONVECTIVE INITIATION AND INTENSIFICATION
IN THIS PROJECT, WE COMBINE THE STRENGTHS OF REAL-TIME, NETWORKED CASA OBSERVATIONS WITH THE STRENGTHS OF OTHER LOCAL, REAL-TIME IN-SITU OR REMOTE OBSERVATIONS TO PROVIDE INCREASED INFORMATION TO THE FORECASTER OF IMPENDING CONVECTIVE INITIATION AND GROWTH/DECAY TRENDS OF A STORM SYSTEM. THIS APPROACH PROVIDES VERY RAPID INFORMATION ON LOWER TROPOSPHERE, SMALLÃ‚Â­ SCALE FEATURES SUCH AS EMBEDDED TORNADOES, OR CIRCULATIONS ON THE LEADING EDGE OF A QUASI LINEAR CONVECTIVE SYSTEM THAT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO SAFETY IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED IN A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT MANNER, USING STANDARD SERVER RESOURCES HOUSED IN A NWS REGIONAL OFFICE. THE KEY TO CREATING TARGETED, FUSED OBSERVATIONS IS CASA'S METEOROLOGICAL COMMAND AND CONTROL (MCC). THE MCC'S RADAR CONTROL ALGORITHMS CAN DYNAMICALLY CHANGE THE SPEED, WAVEFORM, AND VOLUME COVERAGE PATTERNS FOR CASA RADARS IN RESPONSE TO AN EXTERNAL TRIGGER. THAT TRIGGER COULD BE DATA FROM ANOTHER SENSOR, REFLECTIVITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS, THE LOCATION OF BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE (SUCH AS AN ARENA), MODEL OUTPUT, OR A COMBINATION OFTRIGGERS. TASKS ARE MCC WORK RELATED TO:

Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢  DEVELOP AND TEST PRODUCTS FOR TARGETED, FUSED OBSERVATIONS (APPROX. 1-5 MINUTE UPDATES, 250M RESOLUTION) COMBINING CASA WITH NON-CASA JIGHTNING, RADAR, AND/OR SATELLITE DATA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERE WEATHER INTENSIFICATION TREND PRODUCTS (NOWCASTS AND REAL TIME).

LEP populations face substantial barriers to high-quality healthcare, resulting in disparate outcomes such as elevated risk for serious safety events, increased costs, and decreased comprehension, satisfaction, and adherence. Professional interpretation is an evidence-based practice to improve care and mitigate these disparities. However, its use remains persistently low despite legal and regulatory mandates. Previous strategies to improve use have mainly addressed intrapersonal barriers (provider knowledge and skills, via in -person education) or the system (simplifying telephone interpreter access). Educational strategies have improved provider knowledge with unknown effect on interpreter use; systems strategies have achieved modest improvements in use. However, these strategies have lacked clearly articulated mechanisms or causal pathways, often as part of expensive, multifaceted interventions that limit precise attribution and scalability.  In this study, the investigators will compare two discrete implementation strategies for improving interpreter use, the first an enhanced education strategy targeting primarily intrapersonal barriers but delivered in a scalable format (interactive web-based educational modules), and the second targeting system barriers, with a novel focus on mobile video interpretation (mVI), accessible on providers’ own mobile devices. The study’s specific aims are: (1) Compare the effectiveness of two implementation strategies, alone and in combination, to improve use of interpretation and comprehension for LEP patients/parents seen in adult/pediatric primary care settings; (2) Explore mVI and education implementation strategies’ ability to activate putative provider-level mechanisms; and (3) Determine the incremental cost effectiveness from a healthcare organization perspective of each implementation strategy (mVI, education, both). To accomplish these aims, the investigators will conduct a Type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness study in 6 primary care clinics, using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design . Enrolled providers (total n=50) will be randomized to mVI or educational modules, in addition to standard interpreter access. After 9 months, providers with high interpreter use will continue as assigned; those with lower use will be randomized to continue as before or add the alternative implementation strategy. Providers will complete surveys and in-depth interviews to understand barriers to interpreter use, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. LEP patients will be surveyed (n=648) and interviewed (n=75) following visits with enrolled providers to understand their experiences with communication and interpretation. Determining how these two scalable strategies, alone and in sequence, perform for improving interpreter use, how they do so, and at what cost, will provide critical insights for addressing a persistent cause of healthcare disparities.",93.307: MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH,sub-grant,CB9E5918-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,2,12723SUB,633002.00,2023-01-31,2023,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,NFJ3CMQ4B418,042803536,,USA,United States,4333 BROOKLYN AVE NE,SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981950001,WA-07,WA-07,,"U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981959472.0,WA-07,WA-07,USA,United States,"TOTAL AMOUNT OF SUBAWARD REPORTED 11/2022 WAS MISTYPED AS 663002.

In this study, the investigators will compare two discrete implementation strategies for improving interpreter use, the first an enhanced education strategy targeting primarily intrapersonal barriers but delivered in a scalable format (interactive web-based educational modules), and the second targeting system barriers, with a novel focus on mobile video interpretation (mVI), accessible on providers’ own mobile devices. The study’s specific aims are: (1) Compare the effectiveness of two implementation strategies, alone and in combination, to improve use of interpretation and comprehension for LEP patients/parents seen in adult/pediatric primary care settings; (2) Explore mVI and education implementation strategies’ ability to activate putative provider-level mechanisms; and (3) Determine the incremental cost effectiveness from a healthcare organization perspective of each implementation strategy (mVI, education, both). To accomplish these aims, the investigators will conduct a Type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness study in 6 primary care clinics, using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design . Enrolled providers (total n=50) will be randomized to mVI or educational modules, in addition to standard interpreter access. After 9 months, providers with high interpreter use will continue as assigned; those with lower use will be randomized to continue as before or add the alternative implementation strategy. Providers will complete surveys and in-depth interviews to understand barriers to interpreter use, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. LEP patients will be surveyed (n=648) and interviewed (n=75) following visits with enrolled providers to understand their experiences with communication and interpretation. Determining how these two scalable strategies, alone and in sequence, perform for improving interpreter use, how they do so, and at what cost, will provide critical insights for addressing a persistent cause of healthcare disparities.",93.307: MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH,sub-grant,CB9E666A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2022,11,12723SUB,663002.00,2022-11-30,2023,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,NFJ3CMQ4B418,042803536,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,USA,United States,4333 BROOKLYN AVE NE,SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981950001,WA-07,WA-07,,"U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981950001.0,WA-07,WA-07,USA,United States,"THE UW SUBCONTRACT WILL INCLUDE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE UW DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE, THE DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES.

We also aim to estimate the effects of a hypothetical intervention of reducing water contaminant levels on risk of fetal loss. The relationships between drinking water contaminants and risks of miscarriage and stillbirth have not been investigated in California since the early 1980s. As climate change threatens the quality of drinking water in the state, it is important to better understand how climate-sensitive drinking water contaminants affect reproductive health. There is a significant gap in research on environmental determinants of fetal loss at a population level. This is likely due to the challenges in studying early fetal loss, as existing data sources have difficulty capturing miscarriage. However, electronic health record data can help us improve our knowledge of fetal loss between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation, when many pregnant people have received a prenatal care visit but whose pregnancies would not be captured in birth records. We propose to use Sutter Health’s electronic medical records to identify pregnancies, and link participants to community water system boundaries using residential address at each clinic visit. We will then assign water contaminant levels based on the annual average contaminant levels collected from public water monitoring information at the water system level in California. The goals of this project are to 1) characterize the rate of fetal loss in a diverse California cohort, 2) evaluate the individual and mixture effects of climate-sensitive water contaminants on rates of fetal loss, and 3) assess whether reducing all water contaminants to their 50th percentiles observed in the study cohort reduces the risk of fetal loss. The research plan is supported by a strong team of investigators from UCSF, Sutter Health, UC Berkeley, and Columbia University. The investigators have a strong history of collaboration and experience working with electronic health records. They bring significant expertise in reproductive health, drinking water contaminants, climate change, and environmental justice. This research addresses a significant gap in the literature and aligns with both NIEHS’s goal to generate evidence that can be used by policymakers to improve population health, and NICHD’s goals to understand contributors to pregnancy loss and to help identify targets for effective prevention of health disparities.",93.113: ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,sub-grant,CDBB4FB2-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,10,2(GG017336-01),28000.00,2024-07-11,2024,HRW3LUDLLCH5,121816615,SUTTER HEALTH,,HRW3LUDLLCH5,121816615,SUTTER HEALTH,USA,United States,2200 RIVER PLAZA DR,SACRAMENTO,CA,CALIFORNIA,958334134,CA-06,CA-06,,"HOSPITAL,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION",WALNUT CREEK,CA,CALIFORNIA,945967340.0,CA-10,CA-10,USA,United States,"1. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF FETAL LOSS ARE NOT WELL-KNOWN. IN PARTICULAR, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
DRINKING WATER CONTAMINANTS AND FETAL LOSS BEFORE 20 WEEKS GESTATION HAVE NOT BEEN WELL-STUDIED, LIKELY
DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFYING MISCARRIAGE IN A GENERAL POPULATION. THERE IS, HOWEVER, EVIDENCE TO
SUGGEST A POTENTIAL LINK.

TO THAT END WE PLAN TO ENGAGE ONE OR MORE INFORMATION SECURITY PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THE COUNTY'S IT SECURITY PROGRAM. THE REVIEW WOULD INCLUDE EXISTING INTERNAL, EXTERNAL AND PHYSICAL CONTROLS (OR LACK THEREOF) FOR ALL COUNTY DEPARTMENTS, INTERAGENCY CONNECTIONS AND PUBLIC-FACING SERVICES. THE PROJECT WILL CONSIST OF THREE MAJOR PHASES: SECURITY ASSESSMENT, POLICY DEVELOPMENT, AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT. POST-PROJECT ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BE FUNDED INTERNALLY WILL INCLUDE END-USER AWARENESS TRAINING, INCIDENT SIMULATIONS, RESOURCE ACQUISITION (HARDWARE/SOFTWARE/SERVICES) AND PERIODIC POLICY/PROCEDURE REVIEW. 

BY ASSESSING OUR CURRENT RESOURCES AND PRACTICES WE WILL ESTABLISH A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR BUILDING A SET OF POLICIES, TECHNICAL BEST PRACTICES AND OPERATIONS CONTINUITY PLANS. ASSESSMENT WILL FOCUS ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING VULNERABILITIES AND THE DOCUMENTATION OF BEST PRACTICE AND STANDARDS COMPLIANCE OR NON-COMPLIANCE. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INVESTIGATION WILL INCLUDE: 

INTERNAL CONTROLS: END-USER AND DEPARTMENTAL APPROPRIATE USE STANDARDS, END-USER SECURITY AWARENESS, POLICY RELEVANCE, POLICY ENFORCEMENT, ENDPOINT COMPLIANCE SCANNING, PATCHING AND UPDATE PROCEDURES, RESOURCE ACCESS AUDITING, BACKUP, ARCHIVE AND RETENTION 

EXTERNAL CONTROLS: PERIMETER SECURITY (FIREWALLS, LOG MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS), MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION, PEN-TESTING, VPN ACCESS, CONTRACT/VENDOR REMOTE ACCESS AUDITING, WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 

PHYSICAL CONTROLS: PHYSICAL ACCESS RESTRICTIONS TO COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTE AND STORAGE EQUIPMENT, SURVEILLANCE AND ACCESS AUDIT FOR HIGH SECURITY AREAS, SIGNAGE FOR EQUIPMENT AREAS PROXIMATE TO PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AREAS. 

THE POLICY PHASE WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATION BY CONTRACT INFORMATION SECURITY CONSULTANT(S), COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS, OTHER INTERNAL FUNDING SOURCES, EXTERNAL SECURITY PARTNERS, AND IT STAFF. THE POLICIES FORMULATED IN THIS PHASE WOULD ADDRESS THE META-LEVEL DEFICIENCIES DOCUMENTED IN THE ASSESSMENT PHASE. THE WORK PRODUCTS WOULD BE FORMAL POLICY DOCUMENTS ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 

THE THIRD PHASE OF THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS TECHNICAL PLANNING AND PROCESS ISSUES. MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THIS PHASE WILL INCLUDE DOCUMENTING NEW OR IMPROVED PROCESSES RELATED THE THREE CONTROL AREAS INVESTIGATED IN THE ASSESSMENT PHASE, INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANS FOR SCENARIOS INCLUDING MALICIOUS AND NATURAL EVENTS AS WELL AS IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITIZATION OF POST-PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVING OUR PREVENTION AND RECOVERY ABILITIES. 

THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND RECOVER COUNTY IT RESOURCES OVER THE LONG TERM.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_EMW-2020-SS-00018_070/,2021-07-08 00:00:00+00

PI: DR. NHAN DO
BACKGROUND
DR. RAUL MOSTOSLAVSKY FROM MGH HAS BEEN WORKING WITH LIVE MICE TO DETERMINE IF SIRT6 FUNCTIONS AS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME POSITIVE INDICATIONS THAT IT DOES SUPPRESS TUMOR ACTIVITY. DR. RAUL MOSTOSLAVSKY RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE DOD TO STUDY WHETHER SIRT6 FUNCTIONS AS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR IN HUMANS. THERE ARE MANY VETERANS IN THE VA WITH PANCREATIC CANCER. IF THERE IS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIRT6 AND TUMOR SUPPRESSION, IT COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW THERAPIES TO HELP THIS POPULATION.
RESEARCH DESIGN
DR. RAUL MOSTOSLAVSKY HAS MADE A FORMAL DATA REQUEST TO THE PRECISION ONCOLOGY DATA REPOSITORY (PODR IRB #2085) FOR SLIDES AND A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF DATA FROM 20 PATIENTS WITH PANCREATIC CANCER. THIS REQUEST WAS REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED BY THE PODR ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE DATA (SLIDES AND CLINICAL DATA) WILL COME FROM COHORTS A (CONSENTED AND HIPAA AUTHORIZED PARTICIPANTS) AND B (DECEASED, HIPAA WAIVED PATIENTS). TWENTY VETERANSÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢ DATA WILL BE UTILIZED TO FULFILL THIS DATA REQUEST.

SUBRECIPIENT PI AND TEAM WILL LOCATE 20 PATIENTS FROM WITHIN THE PODR WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF PANCREATIC CANCER. THE TEAM WILL LOCATE AN FFPE BLOCK OF TISSUE FROM THE VABHS PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT FOR EACH PATIENT. THE BLOCKS WILL BE INSPECTED BY A LICENSED PATHOLOGIST FOR APPROPRIATE TUMOR PURITY. FROM EACH BLOCK 4-5 UNSTAINED SLIDES WILL BE MADE. INCLUDED WITH THE SLIDES WILL BE THE FOLLOWING DATA POINTS: TUMOR TYPE, TUMOR GRADE, SEX, AGE IF <89YO, PRIMARY VS. RECURRENT DISEASE, AND TREATMENT NAÃƑÂ¯VE OR TREATED. THE SLIDES AND DATA POINTS WILL BE DE-IDENTIFIED AND THE CROSSWALK KEPT BEHIND THE VA FIREWALL. THE SLIDES WILL BE PACKAGED INTO A SLIDE CASE AND SHIPPED TO PTE SITE PI, RAUL MOSTOSLAVSKY. THIS WORK WILL BE PERFORMED WITH OUR EXISTING STAFF, WITH ASSISTANCE FROM PATHOLOGY.
B) DESCRIBE THE WORK/SUPPORT THAT THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE
SUBRECIPEINT WILL RECEIVE $25,000. THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO DEFRAY THE COST OF A PORTION OF THE PI EFFORT

In 2018, there were over 48,000 suicide deaths, and an estimated 1.4 million adults attempted suicide. In response, health systems are adopting suicide risk prediction models to guide delivery of suicide prevention interventions. Suicide prediction models estimated from health care records may perpetuate current disparities in health care access, quality, and outcomes. Suicide prediction models may not accurately identify high-risk patients from all racial and ethnic groups. Suicide rates vary by race and ethnicity, and both the highest and lowest rates are seen in traditionally underserved populations. Suicide rates are highest among American Indians and Alaskan Natives (22.1 per 100,000 people) and lowest in Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic populations (7.0-7.4 per 100,000 people) compared to 18.0 per 100,000 people for White non-Hispanics. Differences in performance of suicide risk prediction models across racial and ethnic subgroups have three possible sources. First, predictors of suicide risk may be measured with error, and this error may be different for racial and ethnic subgroups. Second, suicide attempts and deaths may be misclassified, and misclassification rates may differ by race and ethnicity. Third, the association between predictors and outcomes may vary by race and ethnicity, i.e., risk modification. Existing methods for estimating prediction models are not designed to address racial and ethnic disparities in performance. Estimation procedures focus on optimizing performance across the entire population, not within subgroups, and performance in less prevalent subgroups has little impact on overall accuracy. While machine learning methods, like random forest, explore interactions between predictors and race or ethnicity, suicide attempt and death are rare events, which limits the information available to identify race- and ethnicity-specific risk factors. There is also insufficient guidance on sample size calculations for prediction studies. We will develop novel statistical methods for random forest models that reduce racial and ethnic disparities in performance of suicide prediction models by addressing gaps in current methods. Aim 1 will develop new procedures for prediction model estimation that maximize predictive performance within racial and ethnic subgroups, rather than maximizing average performance across the entire population. Aim 2 will integrate methods to adjust for differential outcome misclassification in prediction model estimation and evaluation. Aim 3 will design sample size calculations to determine if a study is able to accurately predict outcomes within racial and ethnic subgroups. We will use existing data on suicide risk factors and outcomes for 15 million outpatient mental health, 10 million primary care, and 2 million emergency department visits from the NIMH- funded Mental Health Research Network to implement our methods and estimate suicide prediction models for each setting that accurately identify patients at highest risk of suicide across all races and ethnicities.",93.242: MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH GRANTS,sub-grant,CC98F6A2-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2022,7,RNG211776,54875.00,2022-06-03,2022,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,KAISER PERMANENTE,NFJ3CMQ4B418,042803536,,USA,United States,4333 BROOKLYN AVE NE,SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981950001,WA-07,WA-07,,"U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981959472,WA-07,WA-07,USA,United States,"""	THE UW STUDY TEAM INCLUDES DR.

AS ATTACKS AND TECHNIQUES HAVE EVOLVED, SECURITY BEST-PRACTICES SUGGEST THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIREWALLS, INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION, WEB-FILTERING, ANTI-MALWARE, ETC.  FOR ALL OF THESE ADVANCEMENTS IN NETWORK PERIMETER DEFENSES, SADLY THE ONE WEAK-LINK IN THE CHAIN IS US Ã¢Â‚¬Â€Œ THE HUMAN.
FOR ALL THE MONEY THAT THE STATE OF MONTANA HAS INVESTED IN INFORMATION SECURITY, ZERO-DAY THREATS ARISE ON A FREQUENT BASIS.  COUPLED WITH NATION-STATE ACTORS, HACKTIVISTS, AND CYBER-TERRORISTS, THE MINDSET HAS CHANGED FROM Ã¢Â‚¬Å“IFÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ TO Ã¢Â‚¬Å“WHENÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ CONCERNING THE INEVITABILITY OF A DATA BREACH.  WITH AN IN-HOUSE CYBER FORENSICS TOOL, THE STATE INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY OFFICEÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN IS ENHANCED WITH THE ABILITY TO COLLECT DIGITAL EVIDENCE IN A METHOD THAT KEEPS IT INTACT AND USABLE IN REGARDS TO A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OR INTERNAL AUDIT.  THE GOAL OF CYBER FORENSICS IS ACCURACY.  INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS MUST FOLLOW STRICT GUIDELINES TO ENSURE MAXIMUM ACCURACY SHOULD A CYBER-INCIDENT GO TO COURT AS WELL AS MAINTAIN PROPER CHAIN-OF-EVIDENCE TO PROTECT FROM DATA SPOILAGE.
INCIDENT RESPONSE AND HANDLING IS LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER A PUZZLE.  IN ORDER TO SOLVE A PUZZLE, ONE MUST HAVE ALL THE PIECES.  CYBER FORENSICS SUPPLIES A CRITICAL AND CURRENTLY-MISSING PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE.  THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SIFT THROUGH PAST EVENTS ON A DEVICE IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY IN INSTANCES OF A DATA BREACH, WHERE THE AVERAGE BREACH GOES 400+ DAYS BEFORE BEING DISCOVERED.  A CYBER FORENSICS TOOL COULD ALSO BE USED IN SCENARIOS OTHER THAN A DATA BREACH.  HUMAN RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS, FRAUD, LITIGATION, DATA AUDITINGÃ¢Â‚¬Â€?THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES WHERE CYBER FORENSICS CAN REVEAL QUESTIONABLE OR MALICIOUS CONDUCT WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION.
THE CYBER-FORENSICS TOOL THAT THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO USE IS GUIDANCE SOFTWAREÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S ENCASE V. 7 ENTERPRISE.  WITH THIS PRODUCT, A CYBER-FORENSICS EXAMINER WOULD BE ABLE TO ANALYZE MULTIPLE COMPUTERS FROM A CENTRAL LOCATION WITHOUT DISRUPTING ANY BUSINESS.  BEING ABLE TO PULL A DISK IMAGE OVER THE WIRE IS IDEAL WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH DATA BREACHES, ESPECIALLY AS THE BREACH IS OCCURRING.  THE ENCASE ENTERPRISE TOOL IS ABLE TO PULL VOLATILE (MEMORY-RESIDENT) DATA FROM MULTIPLE MACHINES ACROSS THE NETWORK.  DISCRETELY PULLING THIS INFORMATION FROM A WORKSTATION ALLOWS FOR DATA PRESERVATION THAT COULD BE A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE FOR A LITIGATION CASE.  AND THE DATA IS PRESERVED IN AN EVIDENCE FILE FORMAT THAT IS COURT-ACCEPTED.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_EMW2013SS00064_070/,2015-03-23 00:00:00+00

THE STUDY WILL UTILIZE THE INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED BY THE SENTINEL SYSTEM AT HUMANA.1 (SEE LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM RICHARD PLATT, MD) FOR THE STUDY. THE ELECTRONIC DATA USED WILL BE ACCESSED, MAINTAINED, AND PROTECTED, AS PART OF A ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒDISTRIBUTED SYSTEMÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ IN THE EXISTING SECURE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMANA WILL RETAIN PHYSICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER THEIR ELECTRONIC HEALTH DATA BEHIND THEIR INSTITUTIONAL FIREWALLS.

THIS SYSTEM WILL PROTECT THE PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL HEALTH INFORMATION.
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE INSTITUTE AND UMASS CHAN MEDICAL SCHOOL THE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA SET AT HUMANA WILL BE QUERIED TO SELECT A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH AD BASED ON A CLAIMS-BASED ALGORITHM ADAPTED FROM THE ONE USED IN THE D-PRESCRIBE-AD STUDY. AS NO SPECIFIC ICD-10-CM DIAGNOSIS CODES ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ARIA, THE TEAM WILL FIRST DEVELOP SEVERAL CLAIMS-BASED ALGORITHMS FOR ARIA IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR EXPERT CONSULTANT ON NEURORADIOLOGY BASED ON EXISTING DIAGNOSIS CODES MOST REFLECTIVE OF ARIA. USING THE CLAIMS-BASED ALGORITHM, HUMANA WILL SELECT POTENTIAL CASES OF ARIA IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEALTH DATA AMONG THE COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH AD. HUMANA WILL RUN STANDARD QUERIES DEVELOPED BY THE HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE INSTITUTE TO DESCRIBE THE PARTICIPANT CHARACTERS ( DEMOGRAPHICS, RACE AND ETHNICITY, AGE, SEX) AND COMORBIDITY SCORES TO DESCRIBE THE SAMPLE SELECTED FOR STUDY. THE OUTPUT OF QUERIES WILL BE SHARED WITH THE OPERATIONS CENTER VIA A SECURE NETWORK PORTAL.
HUMANA WILL CONTACT RESPECTIVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO REQUEST MEDICAL CHARTS OF THESE SELECTED PATIENTS FOR REVIEW. HUMANA WILL RETRIEVE RECORDS, INCLUDING BRAIN MRI AND CT SCAN REPORTS, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME EXTENDING FROM 30 DAYS BEFORE TO 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE RELEVANT DIAGNOSIS OF ARIA. HUMANA INTENDS TO USE MEDVIEWHEALTH, A VENDOR TO CONTACT MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND SOURCE MRI AND CT REPORTS.
RECORDS WILL BE DEIDENTIFIED TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF PARTICIPANTS AND SHARED BY HUMANA WITH THE TEAM AT THE UMASS CHAN MEDICAL SCHOOL UNDER A DATA USE AGREEMENT. HUMANA WILL REQUEST RECORDS FOR 150 PATIENTS AND ANTICIPATE RETREIVAL OF 100 CHARTS WITH COMPLETE INFORMATION.

Inappropriate prescribing is a “morbidity multiplier,” increasing overall symptom burden, and adversely affecting health-related quality of life and function. Inappropriate prescribing of certain drug categories such as sedative/hypnotics, antipsychotics, highly anticholinergic agents, and certain oral hypoglycemic medications poses particular risks for older adults, and may be more prevalent among those with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) due to a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and associated polypharmacy. The Developing a PRogram to Educate and Sensitize Caregivers to Reduce the Inappropriate Prescription Burden in Elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease Study (D-PRESCRIBE- AD) will test a health plan-based intervention leveraging the NIH Collaboratory's Distributed Research Network, which uses the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel Initiative infrastructure. The overarching goal of our proposal is to develop, implement, and evaluate the effect of a patient/caregiver-centered, multifaceted educational intervention on inappropriate prescribing in patients with AD/ADRD. Our research hypothesis is that education on inappropriate prescribing among patients/caregivers and their providers can reduce medication-related morbidity in patients with AD/ADRD and lead to an improvement in medication safety for this vulnerable population. Our study population will include community-dwelling patients with AD/ADRD, identified based on a diagnosis of AD/ADRD or use of a medication for Alzheimer’s Disease, who have evidence of inappropriate prescribing. We will evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed to stimulate patient/caregiver-provider communication about medication safety (versus usual care) on the proportion of patients with inappropriate prescribing, the primary outcome of this study. The trial will be health plan-based, conducted in two large, national health plans. The study design will be a prospective, cluster randomized, comparative effectiveness intervention trial with three arms: (1) a combined patient/caregiver and provider educational intervention; (2) a provider only educational intervention; and (3) usual care. A one-year R61 planning phase will precede a four-year R33 implementation phase. During the R33 phase we will sequentially implement two separate pragmatic trials, each enrolling over 11,000 patients, adapting the second trial based on the findings and experience gained in the first. The R33 aims are: (1) to assess the impact of the patient/caregiver educational intervention on inappropriate prescribing to AD/ADRD patients, employing a prospective, cluster randomized trial design with three arms; and (2) to create a plan for disseminating study findings to stakeholders who might implement the intervention or make decisions about its future use. The proposed study is feasible because our partners include two large, national health plans, we will leverage an existing FDA Sentinel infrastructure, and we have a strong, multidisciplinary research team.",93.866: AGING RESEARCH,sub-grant,CFD3D684-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2022,11,SUB00000044,170567.00,2022-11-28,2023,NZVVQ8GNVX65,071721088,HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE INC,UMASS CHAN MEDICAL SCHOOL,,,,USA,United States,1 WELLNESS WAY,CANTON,MA,MASSACHUSETTS,020211166,MA-07,MA-08,,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,BOSTON,MA,MASSACHUSETTS,22153325.0,MA-08,MA-90,USA,United States,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE (HPHC) WILL CONDUCT THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES AS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE

Inappropriate prescribing is a “morbidity multiplier,” increasing overall symptom burden, and adversely affecting health-related quality of life and function. Inappropriate prescribing of certain drug categories such as sedative/hypnotics, antipsychotics, highly anticholinergic agents, and certain oral hypoglycemic medications poses particular risks for older adults, and may be more prevalent among those with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) due to a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and associated polypharmacy. The Developing a PRogram to Educate and Sensitize Caregivers to Reduce the Inappropriate Prescription Burden in Elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease Study (D-PRESCRIBE- AD) will test a health plan-based intervention leveraging the NIH Collaboratory's Distributed Research Network, which uses the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel Initiative infrastructure. The overarching goal of our proposal is to develop, implement, and evaluate the effect of a patient/caregiver-centered, multifaceted educational intervention on inappropriate prescribing in patients with AD/ADRD. Our research hypothesis is that education on inappropriate prescribing among patients/caregivers and their providers can reduce medication-related morbidity in patients with AD/ADRD and lead to an improvement in medication safety for this vulnerable population. Our study population will include community-dwelling patients with AD/ADRD, identified based on a diagnosis of AD/ADRD or use of a medication for Alzheimer’s Disease, who have evidence of inappropriate prescribing. We will evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed to stimulate patient/caregiver-provider communication about medication safety (versus usual care) on the proportion of patients with inappropriate prescribing, the primary outcome of this study.

Despite the positive downward trend seen with violent crime, there has been an uptick in the number of property crimes that have occurred in the state with a 9% increase in property crime offenses in 2022. Of the total 817,637 index offenses committed in 2022, property crimes accounted for 84% of those crimes. The Legislative Budget Board stated in their Statewide Criminal and Juvenile Justice Recidivism and Revocation Rates report in February 2023 that, regarding individuals released from a prison or state jail facility in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 that were rearrested within three years of their release or start of supervision, the most prevalent type of offense for which individuals were rearrested was a drug offense and the most prevalent type of offense for which individuals were reincarcerated was a drug or property offense. The Texas Office of the Governors Public Safety Office (PSO) proposes to use its FY2023 Byrne JAG funds to further support the reduction of crime and making Texas a safer place which includes helping victims of crime recover and feel safe again while building trust within the communities with local law enforcement. Grant funds may be used to provide additional law enforcement and court personnel, specialized equipment and training for law enforcement, officer wellness programs, pre-trial diversion programs, jail or prison-based treatment programs, reentry programs, community policing and community-based violence prevention programs, and specialized software and training for court and correctional personnel.

ACT is set in a healthcare delivery system. The study team identifies incident cases of dementia and Alzheimer's disease and follows consenting participants to autopsy. The Program will transform the current ACT U01 to a U19, which envisions complex multi-component programs that will have a powerful influence on the field. The Program's overarching goal is to identify risk factors across the life course that provide potential intervention targets for preserving cognition and preventing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The Overall Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Expand ACT cohort enrollment and modernize and improve follow-up with emphasis on increasing racial/ethnic diversity and deep phenotyping of life course risk factors, cognitive and physical functioning, and outcomes including neuroimaging and neuropathology based ADRD outcomes. The Cores will expand cohort enrollment from 2,000 to 3,000. The study will invest in six Cores: A, Administrative; B, Clinical; C, Life Course; D, Neuropathology; E, Neuroimaging; F, Data and Analysis. These Cores will work together to further enhance the value of ACT's resources, enabling the ACT study to continue to be the foundation for an extraordinary array of science. To date, ACT has achieved a completeness of follow-up index of 94.5% and has observed 56,140 person-years of follow-up. ACT has identified >1,300 incident dementia cases and >1,000 incident Alzheimer's cases. The study has completed >850 autopsies and will surpass 1,100 autopsies this cycle. Additionally, 1,077 ACT participants had one MRI scan, and 540 have had =2, with funding in place for hundreds more. Aim 2. Support key Projects studying the spectrum of healthy functioning to ADRD in older adults. The three Projects center around 24-hour cycle physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep patterns in old age (Project 1), the implications of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups (Project 2), and mechanisms underlying neural protection and toxicity of strong anticholinergic drugs and antihypertensive drugs (Project 3). Aim 3. Expand and improve ACT's dissemination of exceptional resources to the research community guided by NIA's adopted FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) principles. ACT has proven to be an exceptional resource to the research community, providing data and specimens to research colleagues locally, across the country, and around the world, and provides mentorship to junior investigators.

Although the prognosis of breast cancer patients is generally favorable due to early detection and comprehensive treatment, 20%–30% of patients will still develop distant metastases and cases with progressive stage only have a median two-year survival time. Breast cancer is widely recognized as a heterogeneous disease in the sense of both primary tumor metastatic capacity and time to metastatic spread of disease. High-quality population-based cancer surveillance data are needed to: (1) describe cancer burden, patterns, and outcomes in order to (2) inform cancer prevention, detection and control activities; and (3) evaluate interventions on the basis of past and future trends so that optimal approaches to alleviate burden and suffering from cancer can be adopted. However, the laborious manual curation process makes the population wise surveillance data collection challenging. It has been shown in studies that a large percentage of total registry cost is devoted to labor for data curation, even in the low-income countries. In this project, our mission is to build a flexible NLP toolset that can be executed locally at the institution level and will curate the clinical and patient-centered outcomes of breast cancer patients by parsing longitudinally acquired clinic notes, radiology and pathology reports. In order to test the generalizability of the tools and to initiate their deployment for data collection, we will partner with both Georgia SEER and California state cancer registry and will curate the outcome data of past 10-years breast cancer patients from two institutions across US representing diverse patient populations - Emory University hospital (Georgia) and Stanford Medical Center (California). We will leverage the previously developed tools and technologies and extend them to automatically curate the clinical and patient- centered outcome data – recurrence date and site of recurrence, treatment administered, mental and physical outcomes – from clinic notes and convert these into structured and query-able format. The NLP tools will be dockerized and run locally at the hospital registry level for automated outcome curation. Finally, the NLP extracted outcomes will be shared with State Cancer registry for evaluation. From a methodological perspective, the framework and the open-source software tools developed can be employed for cancer research beyond the scope of our project for curating outcomes regardless of the problem domain.",93.393: CANCER CAUSE AND PREVENTION RESEARCH,sub-grant,211686AE-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,10,EMO-303290-01,39982.00,2023-09-29,2023,S352L5PJLMP8,066469933,EMORY UNIVERSITY,,,,,USA,United States,201 DOWMAN DR,ATLANTA,GA,GEORGIA,303221061,GA-05,GA-05,,"PRIVATE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION",ATLANTA,GA,GEORGIA,303224201,GA-05,GA-05,USA,United States,"THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN OPEN-SOURCE GENERALIZABLE NLP TOOLKIT FOR CURATION OF PATIENTCENTERED AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES AUTOMATICALLY BY PARSING THE FREE-TEXT CLINIC NOTES.

FL is advantageous as it can: 1) overcome cultural/ownership, privacy, and regulatory concerns (since data never leave the local site), 2) provide access to restricted data, 3) allow the collection of meaningful amounts of data for analyses of rare diseases, and 4) address health disparities and inequities. Thus, FL can be noted as a novel paradigm for multi-site collaborations, enabling access to ample and importantly diverse data, essential to developing robust models generalizable in unseen data. To this end, we have developed the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform and the Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) library, as open-source tools with a commercially friendly license that have facilitated a) the largest to-date real-world federation, involving 3D brain tumor MRI data from 71 sites across 6 continents, and b) the very first computational challenge in FL, forming the first benchmarking environment and dataset in the field. This FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure has further been used to c) identify tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in histopathology images and d) segment dense tissue in 2D digital mammography (DM), highlighting its generalizability in different imaging and disease types. Building upon our successful FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure, we propose to enhance its functionality with new developments on privacy-aware FL towards classification workloads and evaluate it on a first-of-its-kind use case on breast cancer (BC) risk assessment. BC is the most diagnosed cancer in the US, the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer in women, and screening is performed routinely with 2D digital mammography (DM) for women in their 40s-50s. However, DM yields a lot of false positives and unnecessary subsequent procedures. To alleviate these issues, 3D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) has been developed and increasingly replacing DM. Our group has developed novel volumetric breast density (VBD) measures from DBT scans. Building upon our team’s collective pioneering work in FL and BC risk assessment, in this proposal we focus on developing a trustworthy, zero-code principle FL framework for training AI-based classification models and built-in functionality to i) generate realistic synthetic data, matching local population characteristics, for data augmentation & privacy preservation, and ii) automatically determine quantitative & interpretable settings of optimal privacy preservation. We will use this framework to perform the largest to-date evaluation of training deep-learning models for BC risk assessment using DBT VBD measures and other established risk factors while leveraging multi-site, ethnically diverse data of women undergoing BC screening. We will also disseminate resources via distribution of source code, deployment to collaborating sites, and organization of training activities. Our overarching goal is an easy-to-use translatable trustworthy FL framework, lowering the barrier for under-served populations to participate in large- scale FL studies, and paving the way to address health disparities, towards accelerating discovery healthcare.",93.394: CANCER DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS RESEARCH,sub-grant,29B85E54-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,11,9989,65493.00,2024-11-11,2025,F4N1QNPB95M4,049179401,THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK,INDIANA UNIVERSITY INDIANAPOLIS,,,,USA,United States,"615 W 131ST ST

This FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure has further been used to c) identify tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in histopathology images and d) segment dense tissue in 2D digital mammography (DM), highlighting its generalizability in different imaging and disease types. Building upon our successful FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure, we propose to enhance its functionality with new developments on privacy-aware FL towards classification workloads and evaluate it on a first-of-its-kind use case on breast cancer (BC) risk assessment. BC is the most diagnosed cancer in the US, the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer in women, and screening is performed routinely with 2D digital mammography (DM) for women in their 40s-50s. However, DM yields a lot of false positives and unnecessary subsequent procedures. To alleviate these issues, 3D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) has been developed and increasingly replacing DM. Our group has developed novel volumetric breast density (VBD) measures from DBT scans. Building upon our team’s collective pioneering work in FL and BC risk assessment, in this proposal we focus on developing a trustworthy, zero-code principle FL framework for training AI-based classification models and built-in functionality to i) generate realistic synthetic data, matching local population characteristics, for data augmentation & privacy preservation, and ii) automatically determine quantitative & interpretable settings of optimal privacy preservation. We will use this framework to perform the largest to-date evaluation of training deep-learning models for BC risk assessment using DBT VBD measures and other established risk factors while leveraging multi-site, ethnically diverse data of women undergoing BC screening. We will also disseminate resources via distribution of source code, deployment to collaborating sites, and organization of training activities. Our overarching goal is an easy-to-use translatable trustworthy FL framework, lowering the barrier for under-served populations to participate in large- scale FL studies, and paving the way to address health disparities, towards accelerating discovery healthcare.",93.394: CANCER DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS RESEARCH,sub-grant,29B86476-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,1,9989,123660.00,2024-01-25,2024,GB2SZDLFXZ37,789007213,THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK,INDIANA UNIVERSITY IUPUI,,,,USA,United States,615 W 131ST ST,NEW YORK,NY,NEW YORK,100277922,NY-13,NY-13,,"PRIVATE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION",NEW YORK,NY,NEW YORK,100277922.0,NY-13,NY-13,USA,United States,"AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER (CUIMC), COLLECTION AND FEDERATED ANALYSIS OF ALL COLLECTED DIGITAL

Its mission is to safely operate and maintain sophisticated arrays of instruments and associated infrastructure that collect, archive, and distribute quality oceanic and marine atmospheric data to the ocean and Earth science communities. OOI measurements provide comprehensive insights into the Earth, ocean, and atmosphere for scientists, educators, students, laypersons, industry, and policymakers. OOI data and derived products improve our understanding of the processes that impact climate variability, ecosystems, fisheries, geohazards, and the subseafloor environment, which in turn advance the capabilities of decision-makers charged with the stewardship of ocean resources. Common and open access to OOI data and resources fosters partnerships between international academic and non-academic organizations. All OOI data are backed up by documented procedures and metadata, distributed freely to users via a common web portal (at www.oceanobservatories.org), and archived. OOI?s open data policies support early career scientists and investigators as well as an array of educational programs. The breadth and depth of capabilities provided by the OOI provide transformative scientific and educational opportunities for the community at large. OOI manages and operates five ocean arrays located at scientifically strategic locations in the open ocean (Global Arrays), shelf waters (Coastal Arrays), and on the seabed (Cabled Array). The Global Irminger Sea Array (off Greenland) provides physical, biological, and chemical measurements of the water column. It captures mesoscale variability and air-sea fluxes in a region of documented deep-water formation, which impacts the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and changes in ocean heat transport. The Station Papa Array (Gulf of Alaska) quantifies water column properties and mesoscale variability in a region of longstanding scientific interest for studies ranging from ocean circulation and air-sea fluxes to carbon cycling and biological productivity amongst others. In 2024, the Pioneer Array will be relocated to the Mid-Atlantic Bight where it will enable new science and educational opportunities in a high-energy continental shelf environment. Its design will address the influence of the strong western boundary current in this part of the Atlantic as well as terrestrial freshwater inputs to the biologically productive and diverse ecosystems found there. The Regional Cabled Array brings high-power and high-bandwidth capacity, which allows real-time, two-way communications with the oceans. It will continue to provide new insights into interlinked seismic, volcanic, and hydrothermal processes operating off the Oregon coast, the flux of methane from the seafloor, and the seafloor biosphere. The Endurance Array provides interdisciplinary observations within the coastal upwelling region of the Oregon and Washington coasts, provides observations of the eastern boundary current regime at both short and longer, climate-relevant time scales that lead to new insights into shelf/slope nutrient exchange, air-sea property exchange, carbon cycling, and ocean acidification. This renewal award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), for continued operations and management, builds upon the accomplishments of the initial award and incorporates new operational and outreach changes in response to community input.

Its mission is to safely operate and maintain sophisticated arrays of instruments and associated infrastructure that collect, archive, and distribute quality oceanic and marine atmospheric data to the ocean and Earth science communities. OOI measurements provide comprehensive insights into the Earth, ocean, and atmosphere for scientists, educators, students, laypersons, industry, and policymakers. OOI data and derived products improve our understanding of the processes that impact climate variability, ecosystems, fisheries, geohazards, and the subseafloor environment, which in turn advance the capabilities of decision-makers charged with the stewardship of ocean resources. Common and open access to OOI data and resources fosters partnerships between international academic and non-academic organizations. All OOI data are backed up by documented procedures and metadata, distributed freely to users via a common web portal (at www.oceanobservatories.org), and archived. OOI?s open data policies support early career scientists and investigators as well as an array of educational programs. The breadth and depth of capabilities provided by the OOI provide transformative scientific and educational opportunities for the community at large. OOI manages and operates five ocean arrays located at scientifically strategic locations in the open ocean (Global Arrays), shelf waters (Coastal Arrays), and on the seabed (Cabled Array). The Global Irminger Sea Array (off Greenland) provides physical, biological, and chemical measurements of the water column. It captures mesoscale variability and air-sea fluxes in a region of documented deep-water formation, which impacts the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and changes in ocean heat transport. The Station Papa Array (Gulf of Alaska) quantifies water column properties and mesoscale variability in a region of longstanding scientific interest for studies ranging from ocean circulation and air-sea fluxes to carbon cycling and biological productivity amongst others. In 2024, the Pioneer Array will be relocated to the Mid-Atlantic Bight where it will enable new science and educational opportunities in a high-energy continental shelf environment. Its design will address the influence of the strong western boundary current in this part of the Atlantic as well as terrestrial freshwater inputs to the biologically productive and diverse ecosystems found there. The Regional Cabled Array brings high-power and high-bandwidth capacity, which allows real-time, two-way communications with the oceans. It will continue to provide new insights into interlinked seismic, volcanic, and hydrothermal processes operating off the Oregon coast, the flux of methane from the seafloor, and the seafloor biosphere. The Endurance Array provides interdisciplinary observations within the coastal upwelling region of the Oregon and Washington coasts, provides observations of the eastern boundary current regime at both short and longer, climate-relevant time scales that lead to new insights into shelf/slope nutrient exchange, air-sea property exchange, carbon cycling, and ocean acidification. This renewal award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), for continued operations and management, builds upon the accomplishments of the initial award and incorporates new operational and outreach changes in response to community input. WHOI, the University of Washington (UW), and Oregon State University (OSU) will continue to provide scientific and technical management and operation and maintenance for the next phase of the Ocean Observatories Initiative. The organizational structure of the initial award will be retained with the Program Management Office (PMO) residing at WHOI under the direction of the National Science Foundation. Each of the three institutions will continue to maintain the marine and computing assets for which they are currently responsible; WHOI will operate the Pioneer Array, and the two Global Arrays in the Irminger Sea and at Station Papa, UW will operate the Regional Cabled Array, and OSU will operate the Endurance Array and the Cyberinfrastructure systems, including data ingestion and delivery. Performance metrics for OOI include quantification of scientific output, program management, systems performance, data usage, data quality, and community engagement.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of US cancer morbidity and mortality for both men and women, responsible for more deaths than breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers combined. Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduced lung cancer mortality by 20%. Successful population-based screening requires continuous monitoring to adherence repeat screening in high risk adults to achieve similar results. Repeat annual screening is necessary for early detection of lung cancer. Baseline or first LDCT scans detect prevalent lung cancer, when subsequent screening detects new nodules. However, adherence to screening is low, ranging at 28-38% from centers nationally. Multilevel interventions, which target patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems, offer a promising framework to address the gaps in lung cancer screening to achieve guideline- recommended lung cancer screening. Our mixed-methods pilot study with KPWA stakeholders two critical components to improve adherence to repeat screening: providing education for patients on lung cancer screening, and offering reminders for on-time return to screening. We developed two novel patient-centered interventions using principles of human-centered design to address these needs: 1) Patient Voices Video that incorporates patient testimonials to acknowledge receipt of screening, a tailored reminder of time due for next scan, and reassurance to reduce fear of screening and role of loved ones to support health choices; and 2) Stepped Reminders, that directly reminds patients when their next scan is due. Both interventions are facilitated by a health system electronic health record (EHR) build to track patients for population health management and a clinically-embedded medical assistant to deliver interventions. The goal of this proposal is to test these two interventions relative to usual care to promote adherence to repeat screening in a pragmatic cluster randomized trial enrolling 1775 adult KPWA members, who complete a screening LDCT in 2022-2025 across 34 KPWA primary care clinics in a 2x2 factorial-designed study. Study arms include: a) Stepped Reminders alone; b) Patient Voices Video alone; c) both interventions; or d) usual care. To address our goals, our specific aims are to: 1) Compare effectiveness of two multilevel interventions relative to usual care in improving (a) rates of adherence to lung cancer screening, (b) patient-centered outcomes; and (c) clinic outcomes; and 2) Determine the patient-, clinician-, and system-level factors that influence changes in adherence to inform lung cancer screening programs. To date, no randomized clinical trial has evaluated strategies to improve adherence to lung cancer screening in US populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective, scalable interventions to improve lung cancer screening adherence to achieve the population-based mortality benefits promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening guidelines.",93.393: CANCER CAUSE AND PREVENTION RESEARCH,sub-grant,C51B66DA-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,7,RNG212755-UW,38774.00,2024-06-11,2024,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,,,,,USA,United States,4333 BROOKLYN AVE NE,SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981951016,WA-07,WA-07,,"U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",SEATTLE,WA,WASHINGTON,981959472,WA-07,WA-07,USA,United States,"""ANJALI VASAVADA ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT

Evaluations of prevention programs typically assume that one individual?s behavior does not affect anyone else?s. If individuals exposed to crime intervention transmit their improvements in skills, beliefs, or time use to their peers, ignoring these spillovers could understate or alternatively overstate an intervention?s total impact. This project will document how changes in criminal behavior spread through social networks by combining four existing experiments with measures of social networks derived from multiple sources of administrative data. It will quantify the direct and indirect effects of these violence-reduction interventions on participants and their peers. The results will generate a better understanding of the overall effect of each program, as well as the role of peers in shaping criminal decision-making more broadly. The project will provide actionable information on how to effectively target crime prevention programs in the future by describing whom program operators should serve to maximize net crime reduction benefits. The results will also help to establish the US as global leader in crime reducing policies. This project will estimate the effects of social networks on crime intervention programs. Estimating social spillovers faces two key challenges: measuring social networks and causally identifying peer effects. This research addresses the first challenge by combining population-wide administrative police and school records in Chicago to capture different kinds of social connections. The PIs solve the second challenge by combining the network information with exogenous variation in crime and violence generated by four existing RCTs in Chicago, all focusing on low income youth. Using these data, the PIs will construct the social network between individuals at the time each intervention was randomly assigned. The random variation from the RCTs will allow the PIs to test whether and how treatment changes behavior?both via direct participation and via indirect exposure to treated peers?as well as which types of social ties matter. The PIs will test for heterogeneity in peer effects based on demographic, criminal history, and network characteristics of individuals to help understand and model how social interactions generate criminal decisions. Finally, the PIs will us the model to evaluate alternative targeting strategies for future RCTs. The results of this research project will provide important inputs into policies to decrease crime and thus improve public safety in the US. The results will also help to establish the US as global leader in crime reducing policies.

PATIENT POPULATION.WITH 4,092,459 RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE INHABITANTS, HARRIS COUNTY,' WHERE HOUSTON IS LOCATED, IS THE THIRD MOST POPULOUS COUNTY IN THE U.S. AT THE END OF 2010, APPROXIMATELY .19,733 PEOPLE WERE LIVING WITH HIV OR AIDS IN HARRIS COUNTY. THIS NUMBER IS COMPARABLEÃ‚Â·TO THE HIV POSITIVE POPULATION OF SAN FRANCISCO (23,075) AND RANKS HARRIS COUNTY NUMBER EIGHT IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF CITIZENS AFFECTED.

HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS. THE THOMAS STREET.HEALTH CENTER (TSHC), THE FIRST FREEÃ‚Â­ STANDING HIV CLINIC IN THE COUNTRY, IS OPERATED BY HARRIS HEALTH (FORMERLY THE HARRIS COUNTY HOSPITAL DISTRICT). THE TSHC IS THE FOCAL POINT OF HARRIS HEALTH'S HIV PROGRAMS AND IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES FROM THE TEXAS MEDICAL CENTER (TMC) LN DOWNTOWN HOUSTON. OVER 100 STAFF MEMBERA PROVIDE CARE TO APPROXIMATELY 5,549 (28%) OF THE 19,733 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WHO RESIDE IN HOUSTON/HARRIS COUNTY. TSHC CARES PRIMARILY FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS; 61% OF THE
 

PATIENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN, 21% ARE HISPANIC (MOSTLY WHITE), AND 17% Ã‚Â·-ARE WHITE NON HISPANICS. FORTY-NINE PERCENT OF TSCH PATIENTS WERE INFECTED BY HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION, 29% BY MSM CONTACT, 8% IOU, AND 12% ""OTHER"". BEN TAUB GENERAL HOSPITAL (BTGH), IN THE TEXAS MEDICAL CENTER, IS WHERE THE  MAJORITY OF THESE PATIENTS RECEIVE INPATIENT CARE WHEN NEEDED. THE TEXAS MEDICAL CENTER HARRIS HEALTH SMITH CLINIC IS THE LOCATION FOR OUTPATIENT ONCOLOGY CARE INCLUDING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPY; ANOTHER 850 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ARE CARED FOR AT THE MICHAEL E. DEBAKEY VAMC (MEDVAMC}, ALSO LO'CATED IN THE TMC. THESE CLINICAL SITES ARE OVERSEEN BY THE DAN L DUNCAN CANCER CENTER (DLDCC) AT BCM AND STAFFED BY BCM PHYSICIANS. DR. ELIZABETH CHIAO, WHO IS BOARD CERTIFIED IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND MEDICAL ONCOLOGY, PRACTICES AT BQTH TSHC AND THE - BEN TAUB HOSPITAL AND HAS AN NCI FUNDED RESEARCH PROGRAM IN HIV-ASSOCIATED ANAL MALIGNANCIES. DR. CHIAO HAS PUBLISHED IN THE AREA OF AIDS-RELATED MALIGNANCIES AND IS THE BCM PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE AIDS MALIGNANCY CONSORTIUM AND THE TEXAS NEUROAIDS RESEARCH CENTER. DR. CHIAO WILL COORDINATE THE BCM RBR EFFORTS THROUGH HARRIS HEALTH FOCUSING ON RECRUITMENT AND PATIENT FOLLOW-UP. DR MARTHA MIMS, CHIEF OF. HEMATOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY AT BCM WILL COORDINATE AND FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLE ACQUISITION AT THE HOSPITAL SITES AND THE TMC HARRIS HEALT!;I SMITH CLINIC.

HIV-RELATED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT BCM. THE NIH FUNDED BCM-UT HOUSTON CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH (CFAR) IS PART OF A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF AIDS RESEARCH CENTERS AND IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AND FACILITATE MULTIDISCIPLINARY AIDS-RELATED RESEARCH AT BOTH BCM AND THE UT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER. THE CFAR HAS BEEN LOCATED AT BCM SINCE 1991; THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UT AT HOUSTON WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2005. TSHC IS THE CORE OF THE CLINICAL HIV RESEARCH EFFORT AT BCM AND IS THE DESIGNATED AIDS CLINICAL TRIALS GROUP SITE IN HOUSTON, AS WELL AS THE MAIN AIDS MALIGNANCY CONSORTIUM SITE. THE BCM RBR SITE HAS A DATABASE OF 484 INDIVIDUALS WITH HIV WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND HAVE BEEN EVALUATED OR TREATED IN THE HARRIS HEALTH SYSTEM. SEVERAL TISSUE MICROARRAYS OF AIDS-RELATED MALIGNANCIES HAVE BEEN MADE OR ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION WITHIN THE DLDCC HUMAN TISSUE ACQUISITION CORE INCLUDING SEVENTEEN ANAL CANCERS, TEN BREAST CANCERS, TEN LUNG, OVER TWENTY CERVICAL CANCERS, EIGHT GASTRIC CANCERS, FIFTEEN HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMAS, TWELVE OROPHARYNGEAL CANCERS AND NEARLY THIRTY HODGKIN LYMPHOMAS. CLINICAL DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED ON ALL SPECIMENS INCLUDED IN THE TMAS. THE BCM LYMPHOMA SPORE HAS ACTIVELY PROMOTED INVESTIGATION INTO HIV INFECTIONASSOCIATED LYMPHOMAS INCLURNNG A RECENT SEQUENCING STUDY COMPARING BURKITT LYMPHOMA IN HIV POSITIVE AND HIV NEGATIVE SUBJECTS WHICH IS NEARING COMPLETION. THIS STUDY INCLUDES SAMPLES OBTAINED FTOM THE ACSR.

TISSUE Ã‚Â·BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE DAN L. DUNCAN CANCER CENTER IS A NCI-DESIGNATED CANCER CENTER. RESOURCES FROM THE NCI CORE GRANT AND BCM HAVE ENABLED US TO INITIATE BANKING OF FRESH CANCER AND ADJCENT BENIGN TISSUES AT ALL BCM AFFILIATED HOSPITALS, INCLUDING THE BEN TAUB GENERAL HOSPITAL AND THE MICHAEL E. Ã‚Â·DEBAKEY VAMC VIA THE HUMAN TISSUE ACQUISITION AND PATHOLOGY (HTAP} CORE RESOURCE. PERSONNEL ARE DEPLOYED AT BOTH INSTITUTIONS TO CONSENT PATIENTS AND ASSIST WITH FRESH TISSUE QOLLECTION USING AN ESTABLISHED CONSENT PROCESS
 

Ã‚Â·AND PATHOLOGY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES. DR. MICHAEL LTTMANN IS A BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGIST AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE HTAP CORE. HE HAS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN TISSUE BANKING AND EXTENSIVE EX.PERIENCE WITH HIV RELATED MALIGNANCH S. AS THE RBR DIRECTOR, HE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERALL DIRECTION OF THIS RBR. THE MEDVAMC HAS ESTABLISHED AN ARCHIVE OF TWENTY YEARS OF PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED TISSUE BLOCKS, WHICH CONTAINS MORE THAN  140,000 INDIVIDUAL  CASES  THAT  CAN BE LINKED TO  CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP  DATA THROUGH  A
COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD. TEN YEARS OF PARAFFIN BLOCKS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FROM BTGH. BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS.HAVE BEEN USED TO BUILD MULTIPLE TISSUE MICROARRAYS WITH LINKED CLINICAL FOLLOWMUP. THE PHY.SICAL TISSUE BANK IS SUPPORTED BY A COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATICS GROUP LED BY DR. LAUREN BECNEL. THE HTAP INFORMATICS INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SOFTWARE AND ASSOCIATED SUPPORT WILL BE ADAPTED TO SUPPORT THE ASCR EFFORT.

SUMMARY OF CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE: THE BCM RBR IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF A LARGE, ETHNICALLY DIVERSE HIV POSITIVE PATIENT POPULATION. WE HAVE THE CLINICAL, PATHOLOGICAL AND
INFORMATICS EXPERTISE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE ACSR EFFORT. OF NOTE, ORS. CHIAO, MIMS, LTTMANN AND BECNEL HAVE WORKED TOGETHER IN VARIOUS COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS,
,FACILITATING THE SMOOTH OPERATIONS OF THIS RBR SITE.

OPERATIONS OF THE BCM RBR. THE INITIAL STEP IN FRESH TISSUE COLLECTION IS IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS AT EACH OF OUR CLINICAL SITES WITH DAILY SURGICAL SCHEDULES ARE ALSO EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL TISSUE DONORS. PATIENTS ARE APPROACHED FOR TISSUE DONATION BY DEDICATED PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES USING OUR EXISTING IRB APPROVED CONSENT THAT PERMITS ROUTINE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TESTING OF SAMPLES AS WELL AS ADVANCED GENOMIC TESTING AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF SITE PATHOLOGISTS OR PATHOLOGY ASSISTANTS, PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES COLLECT FRESH TISSUE, FLUIDS AND/OR BLOOD FROM CONSENTED PATIENTS. TMOR AND NORMAL TISSUES ARE SNAP FROZEN
IN LIQUID NITROGEN. SECTIONS FOR MOLECULAR  ANALYSIS ARE SEPARATED  BY ""MIRROR"" TISSUE SECTIONS
SUBMITTED FOR FORMALIN FIXATION AND PARAFFIN EMBEDDING FOR IDENTIFICATION OF TISSUE TYPE, PERCENTAGE OF TUMOR/TUMOR NUCLEI AND NECROSIS. A FORMALIN-FIXED PARAFFIN EMBEDDED (FFPE) SAMPLE WITH A MIRROR IMAGE FROZEN TISSUE:IS.PREPARED BY STANDARD TECHNIQUES. THE FFPE SAMPLE IS SENT TO THE RESEARCH HISTOLOGY LABORATORY, WHERE A AN H& E SLIDE IS REVIEWED BY A PATNOLOGLST WHO MAKES A DIAGNOSIS BASED ON ACCEPTED CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR EACH TUMOR TYPE, THE PATHOLOGIST RECORDS THE PERCENT OF TUMOR VERSUS NORMAL NUCLEI AND THE PERCENT NECROSIS PRESENT IN THE SECTION SEMI-QUANTITATIVELY OR BY IMAGE ANALYSIS.

THE BCM RBR UTILIZES A TWODIMENSIONAL BARCODING SYSTEM TO CATALOG ALL TISSUES AND SERA. THE BAR COQE MATERIAL IS CERTIFIED TO WITHSTAND FROZEN  (-BOC) TEMPERATURES  WITHOUT SEPARATING.
INFORMATION CAN BE READ WITHOUT HANDLING THE SPECIMENS WHICH HELPS ENSURE CONTINUOUS RNA QUALITY. ALL FREEZERS T)AVE REDUNDANT, EMERGENCY POWER IN THE EVENT OF A PRIMAR}T POWER FAILURE. FREEZERS HAVE A MONITORED ALARM SYSTEM WHICH SOUNDS AND AUTOMATICALLY TELEPHONES 3 PREÃ‚Â­ DEFINED PERSONNEL IF THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE -65C, OR DROPS BELOW -90C. AS ADDITIONAL BACKMUP, THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SYSTEM OF C02 TANKS THAT DISPERSE C02 INTO THE TRE:EZER IF THE
 

REGIONAL BIOSPECIMEN REPOSITORIES (RBRS)

TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE A SET POINT. IF THE FREEZER TEMPERATURE CONTINUES TO RISE, ACTION IS TAKEN TO PRESERVE THE TISSUES - A SPARE EMPTY, COLD 'FREEZER IS KEPT IN RESERVE AT ALL TIMES- OUR PROCEDURES YIELD HIGH QUALITY TISSUE SUITABLE FOR RNA ANALYSIS AND WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED MULTIPLE QUALIFIED TISSUE SAMPLES TO THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS PROJECT, WHICH HAS HIGHLY STRINGENT STANDARDS FOR TISSUE INTEGRITY, SIZE AND PERCENT VIABLEÃ‚Â·TUMOR. ALL SOP FOR HIV TISSUES WILL BE HARMONIZED Ã‚Â·WITH ACSR SOP AND THE MOO. FOLLOWING CONSENT AND TISSUE COLLECTION, PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES RECORD ALL CLINICAL, DEMOGRAPHIC AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION REAL TIME INTO THE.INFORMATICS DATABASE.

A SECOND MAJOR EFFORT OF THE BCM RBR WILL BE TO CONSTRUCT TISSUE MICROARRAYS (TMAS) USING FFPE TISSUES FROM HIV + PATIENTS TREATED AT DLDCC SITES UNDER EXISTING !RB-APPROVED PROTOCOLS. PATIENTS ARE IDENTIFIED BY SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION OF MEDICAL RECORDS AND TUMOR REGISTRIES, AND BLOCKS ARE COLLECTED Ã‚Â·BY PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES. TMAS ARE CONSTRUCTED BY EXPERIENCED DLDCC PATHOLOGY CORE PERSONNEL UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF DR. TTTMANN, WHO REVIEWS
AND MARKS TUMOR AND NORMAL REGIONS ON SLIDES FROM EACH BLOCK FOR INCLUSION ON THE TMA.
LINKED CLINICAL,DEMOGRAPHIC, PATHOLOGICAL AND OUTCOME DATA WILL BE GATHERED AND LINKED IN A DEÃ‚Â­ IDENTIFIED MANNER TO EACH CASE ON THE ARRAY. PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES  AND THE SITE PROJECT
I
COORDINATOR WILL DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO OBTAINING CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP ON PATIENTS DONATING
FRESH FROZEN TISSUE, OR WHO HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN TMAS AND THIS INFORMATIQN WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE DATABASE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS.

DATA WILL BE ENTERED  INTO THE ACSR DATABASE, ACQUIRE (HTTPS:L/ACQUIRE.RESEARCH.BCM.EDU), A MODULAR SYSTEM THAT SECURELY COMMUNICATES WITH OTHE'R SYSTEMS, UTILIZES COMMON DATA ELEMENTS (CDES) TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL DATA EXCHANGE, RESTRICT DATA ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL AND SUPPORT A VARIETY OF FEATURES INCLUDING SPECIMEN ACQUISITION, CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANNOTATION, GENERATION OF REPORTS AND SHIPPING DOCUMENTS, SPECIMEN DATA DISTRIBUTION OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT, AND MAINTENANCE OF HIGH DATA QUALIFY BY ALERTING BIOBANK
STAFF OF OUTSTANDING TASKS FOR SPECIMENS. THE BCM INFORMATICS GROUP  WILL DETERMINE WHAT CUSTOMIZATIONS TO OUR DATABASE TO SUPPORT ACSR BIOBANKING, DATA EXTRACTION AND MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN ACSR SOP/MOO. THESE NEEDS WILL BE PRIORITIZED AND ASSIGNED TO SOFTWARE ""BUILDS,"" THAT ARE RELEASED EVERY 8-12 WEEKS OVER THE ENTIRE FUNDING
PERIOD. ALL BCM SYSTEMS UTILIZE ENCRYPTED PASSWORDS WITH VIRTUAL ACCESS LIMITED BY THE BCM FIREWALL. SERVERS  ARE HOUSED IN A HIPAA-COMPLIANT TIER ILL DATA CENTER WITH 24-HOUR ON-SITE SECURITY; ACCESS IS LIMITED TO AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITH CARD-BASED ENTRY TO THE ENCLOSED AREA. DATA ARE BACKED UP NIGHTLY TO  OFFSITE NETAPP APPLIANCES WITH LONG-TERM  STORAGE ON TAPE; SOFTWARE IS VERSIONED WITHIN A SUBVERSION REPOSITORY AND BACKED UP BIWEEKLY.

PATIENT POPULATION.WITH 4,092,459 RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE INHABITANTS, HARRIS COUNTY,' WHERE HOUSTON IS LOCATED, IS THE THIRD MOST POPULOUS COUNTY IN THE U.S. AT THE END OF 2010, APPROXIMATELY .19,733 PEOPLE WERE LIVING WITH HIV OR AIDS IN HARRIS COUNTY. THIS NUMBER IS COMPARABLEÃ‚Â·TO THE HIV POSITIVE POPULATION OF SAN FRANCISCO (23,075) AND RANKS HARRIS COUNTY NUMBER EIGHT IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF CITIZENS AFFECTED.

HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS. THE THOMAS STREET.HEALTH CENTER (TSHC), THE FIRST FREEÃ‚Â­ STANDING HIV CLINIC IN THE COUNTRY, IS OPERATED BY HARRIS HEALTH (FORMERLY THE HARRIS COUNTY HOSPITAL DISTRICT). THE TSHC IS THE FOCAL POINT OF HARRIS HEALTH'S HIV PROGRAMS AND IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES FROM THE TEXAS MEDICAL CENTER (TMC) LN DOWNTOWN HOUSTON. OVER 100 STAFF MEMBERA PROVIDE CARE TO APPROXIMATELY 5,549 (28%) OF THE 19,733 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WHO RESIDE IN HOUSTON/HARRIS COUNTY. TSHC CARES PRIMARILY FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS; 61% OF THE
 

PATIENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN, 21% ARE HISPANIC (MOSTLY WHITE), AND 17% Ã‚Â·-ARE WHITE NON HISPANICS. FORTY-NINE PERCENT OF TSCH PATIENTS WERE INFECTED BY HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION, 29% BY MSM CONTACT, 8% IOU, AND 12% ""OTHER"". BEN TAUB GENERAL HOSPITAL (BTGH), IN THE TEXAS MEDICAL CENTER, IS WHERE THE  MAJORITY OF THESE PATIENTS RECEIVE INPATIENT CARE WHEN NEEDED. THE TEXAS MEDICAL CENTER HARRIS HEALTH SMITH CLINIC IS THE LOCATION FOR OUTPATIENT ONCOLOGY CARE INCLUDING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPY; ANOTHER 850 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ARE CARED FOR AT THE MICHAEL E. DEBAKEY VAMC (MEDVAMC}, ALSO LO'CATED IN THE TMC. THESE CLINICAL SITES ARE OVERSEEN BY THE DAN L DUNCAN CANCER CENTER (DLDCC) AT BCM AND STAFFED BY BCM PHYSICIANS. DR. ELIZABETH CHIAO, WHO IS BOARD CERTIFIED IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND MEDICAL ONCOLOGY, PRACTICES AT BQTH TSHC AND THE - BEN TAUB HOSPITAL AND HAS AN NCI FUNDED RESEARCH PROGRAM IN HIV-ASSOCIATED ANAL MALIGNANCIES. DR. CHIAO HAS PUBLISHED IN THE AREA OF AIDS-RELATED MALIGNANCIES AND IS THE BCM PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE AIDS MALIGNANCY CONSORTIUM AND THE TEXAS NEUROAIDS RESEARCH CENTER. DR. CHIAO WILL COORDINATE THE BCM RBR EFFORTS THROUGH HARRIS HEALTH FOCUSING ON RECRUITMENT AND PATIENT FOLLOW-UP. DR MARTHA MIMS, CHIEF OF. HEMATOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY AT BCM WILL COORDINATE AND FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLE ACQUISITION AT THE HOSPITAL SITES AND THE TMC HARRIS HEALT!;I SMITH CLINIC.

HIV-RELATED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT BCM. THE NIH FUNDED BCM-UT HOUSTON CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH (CFAR) IS PART OF A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF AIDS RESEARCH CENTERS AND IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AND FACILITATE MULTIDISCIPLINARY AIDS-RELATED RESEARCH AT BOTH BCM AND THE UT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER. THE CFAR HAS BEEN LOCATED AT BCM SINCE 1991; THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UT AT HOUSTON WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2005. TSHC IS THE CORE OF THE CLINICAL HIV RESEARCH EFFORT AT BCM AND IS THE DESIGNATED AIDS CLINICAL TRIALS GROUP SITE IN HOUSTON, AS WELL AS THE MAIN AIDS MALIGNANCY CONSORTIUM SITE. THE BCM RBR SITE HAS A DATABASE OF 484 INDIVIDUALS WITH HIV WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND HAVE BEEN EVALUATED OR TREATED IN THE HARRIS HEALTH SYSTEM. SEVERAL TISSUE MICROARRAYS OF AIDS-RELATED MALIGNANCIES HAVE BEEN MADE OR ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION WITHIN THE DLDCC HUMAN TISSUE ACQUISITION CORE INCLUDING SEVENTEEN ANAL CANCERS, TEN BREAST CANCERS, TEN LUNG, OVER TWENTY CERVICAL CANCERS, EIGHT GASTRIC CANCERS, FIFTEEN HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMAS, TWELVE OROPHARYNGEAL CANCERS AND NEARLY THIRTY HODGKIN LYMPHOMAS. CLINICAL DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED ON ALL SPECIMENS INCLUDED IN THE TMAS. THE BCM LYMPHOMA SPORE HAS ACTIVELY PROMOTED INVESTIGATION INTO HIV INFECTIONASSOCIATED LYMPHOMAS INCLURNNG A RECENT SEQUENCING STUDY COMPARING BURKITT LYMPHOMA IN HIV POSITIVE AND HIV NEGATIVE SUBJECTS WHICH IS NEARING COMPLETION. THIS STUDY INCLUDES SAMPLES OBTAINED FTOM THE ACSR.

TISSUE Ã‚Â·BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE DAN L. DUNCAN CANCER CENTER IS A NCI-DESIGNATED CANCER CENTER. RESOURCES FROM THE NCI CORE GRANT AND BCM HAVE ENABLED US TO INITIATE BANKING OF FRESH CANCER AND ADJCENT BENIGN TISSUES AT ALL BCM AFFILIATED HOSPITALS, INCLUDING THE BEN TAUB GENERAL HOSPITAL AND THE MICHAEL E. Ã‚Â·DEBAKEY VAMC VIA THE HUMAN TISSUE ACQUISITION AND PATHOLOGY (HTAP} CORE RESOURCE. PERSONNEL ARE DEPLOYED AT BOTH INSTITUTIONS TO CONSENT PATIENTS AND ASSIST WITH FRESH TISSUE QOLLECTION USING AN ESTABLISHED CONSENT PROCESS
 

Ã‚Â·AND PATHOLOGY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES. DR. MICHAEL LTTMANN IS A BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGIST AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE HTAP CORE. HE HAS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN TISSUE BANKING AND EXTENSIVE EX.PERIENCE WITH HIV RELATED MALIGNANCH S. AS THE RBR DIRECTOR, HE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERALL DIRECTION OF THIS RBR. THE MEDVAMC HAS ESTABLISHED AN ARCHIVE OF TWENTY YEARS OF PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED TISSUE BLOCKS, WHICH CONTAINS MORE THAN  140,000 INDIVIDUAL  CASES  THAT  CAN BE LINKED TO  CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP  DATA THROUGH  A
COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD. TEN YEARS OF PARAFFIN BLOCKS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FROM BTGH. BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS.HAVE BEEN USED TO BUILD MULTIPLE TISSUE MICROARRAYS WITH LINKED CLINICAL FOLLOWMUP. THE PHY.SICAL TISSUE BANK IS SUPPORTED BY A COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATICS GROUP LED BY DR. LAUREN BECNEL. THE HTAP INFORMATICS INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SOFTWARE AND ASSOCIATED SUPPORT WILL BE ADAPTED TO SUPPORT THE ASCR EFFORT.

SUMMARY OF CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE: THE BCM RBR IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF A LARGE, ETHNICALLY DIVERSE HIV POSITIVE PATIENT POPULATION. WE HAVE THE CLINICAL, PATHOLOGICAL AND
INFORMATICS EXPERTISE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE ACSR EFFORT. OF NOTE, ORS. CHIAO, MIMS, LTTMANN AND BECNEL HAVE WORKED TOGETHER IN VARIOUS COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS,
,FACILITATING THE SMOOTH OPERATIONS OF THIS RBR SITE.

OPERATIONS OF THE BCM RBR. THE INITIAL STEP IN FRESH TISSUE COLLECTION IS IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS AT EACH OF OUR CLINICAL SITES WITH DAILY SURGICAL SCHEDULES ARE ALSO EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL TISSUE DONORS. PATIENTS ARE APPROACHED FOR TISSUE DONATION BY DEDICATED PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES USING OUR EXISTING IRB APPROVED CONSENT THAT PERMITS ROUTINE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TESTING OF SAMPLES AS WELL AS ADVANCED GENOMIC TESTING AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF SITE PATHOLOGISTS OR PATHOLOGY ASSISTANTS, PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES COLLECT FRESH TISSUE, FLUIDS AND/OR BLOOD FROM CONSENTED PATIENTS. TMOR AND NORMAL TISSUES ARE SNAP FROZEN
IN LIQUID NITROGEN. SECTIONS FOR MOLECULAR  ANALYSIS ARE SEPARATED  BY ""MIRROR"" TISSUE SECTIONS
SUBMITTED FOR FORMALIN FIXATION AND PARAFFIN EMBEDDING FOR IDENTIFICATION OF TISSUE TYPE, PERCENTAGE OF TUMOR/TUMOR NUCLEI AND NECROSIS. A FORMALIN-FIXED PARAFFIN EMBEDDED (FFPE) SAMPLE WITH A MIRROR IMAGE FROZEN TISSUE:IS.PREPARED BY STANDARD TECHNIQUES. THE FFPE SAMPLE IS SENT TO THE RESEARCH HISTOLOGY LABORATORY, WHERE A AN H& E SLIDE IS REVIEWED BY A PATNOLOGLST WHO MAKES A DIAGNOSIS BASED ON ACCEPTED CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR EACH TUMOR TYPE, THE PATHOLOGIST RECORDS THE PERCENT OF TUMOR VERSUS NORMAL NUCLEI AND THE PERCENT NECROSIS PRESENT IN THE SECTION SEMI-QUANTITATIVELY OR BY IMAGE ANALYSIS.

THE BCM RBR UTILIZES A TWODIMENSIONAL BARCODING SYSTEM TO CATALOG ALL TISSUES AND SERA. THE BAR COQE MATERIAL IS CERTIFIED TO WITHSTAND FROZEN  (-BOC) TEMPERATURES  WITHOUT SEPARATING.
INFORMATION CAN BE READ WITHOUT HANDLING THE SPECIMENS WHICH HELPS ENSURE CONTINUOUS RNA QUALITY. ALL FREEZERS T)AVE REDUNDANT, EMERGENCY POWER IN THE EVENT OF A PRIMAR}T POWER FAILURE. FREEZERS HAVE A MONITORED ALARM SYSTEM WHICH SOUNDS AND AUTOMATICALLY TELEPHONES 3 PREÃ‚Â­ DEFINED PERSONNEL IF THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE -65C, OR DROPS BELOW -90C. AS ADDITIONAL BACKMUP, THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SYSTEM OF C02 TANKS THAT DISPERSE C02 INTO THE TRE:EZER IF THE
 

REGIONAL BIOSPECIMEN REPOSITORIES (RBRS)

TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE A SET POINT. IF THE FREEZER TEMPERATURE CONTINUES TO RISE, ACTION IS TAKEN TO PRESERVE THE TISSUES - A SPARE EMPTY, COLD 'FREEZER IS KEPT IN RESERVE AT ALL TIMES- OUR PROCEDURES YIELD HIGH QUALITY TISSUE SUITABLE FOR RNA ANALYSIS AND WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED MULTIPLE QUALIFIED TISSUE SAMPLES TO THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS PROJECT, WHICH HAS HIGHLY STRINGENT STANDARDS FOR TISSUE INTEGRITY, SIZE AND PERCENT VIABLEÃ‚Â·TUMOR. ALL SOP FOR HIV TISSUES WILL BE HARMONIZED Ã‚Â·WITH ACSR SOP AND THE MOO. FOLLOWING CONSENT AND TISSUE COLLECTION, PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES RECORD ALL CLINICAL, DEMOGRAPHIC AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION REAL TIME INTO THE.INFORMATICS DATABASE.

A SECOND MAJOR EFFORT OF THE BCM RBR WILL BE TO CONSTRUCT TISSUE MICROARRAYS (TMAS) USING FFPE TISSUES FROM HIV + PATIENTS TREATED AT DLDCC SITES UNDER EXISTING !RB-APPROVED PROTOCOLS. PATIENTS ARE IDENTIFIED BY SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION OF MEDICAL RECORDS AND TUMOR REGISTRIES, AND BLOCKS ARE COLLECTED Ã‚Â·BY PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES. TMAS ARE CONSTRUCTED BY EXPERIENCED DLDCC PATHOLOGY CORE PERSONNEL UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF DR. TTTMANN, WHO REVIEWS
AND MARKS TUMOR AND NORMAL REGIONS ON SLIDES FROM EACH BLOCK FOR INCLUSION ON THE TMA.
LINKED CLINICAL,DEMOGRAPHIC, PATHOLOGICAL AND OUTCOME DATA WILL BE GATHERED AND LINKED IN A DEÃ‚Â­ IDENTIFIED MANNER TO EACH CASE ON THE ARRAY. PATIENT TISSUE ADVOCATES  AND THE SITE PROJECT
I
COORDINATOR WILL DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO OBTAINING CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP ON PATIENTS DONATING
FRESH FROZEN TISSUE, OR WHO HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN TMAS AND THIS INFORMATIQN WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE DATABASE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS.

DATA WILL BE ENTERED  INTO THE ACSR DATABASE, ACQUIRE (HTTPS:L/ACQUIRE.RESEARCH.BCM.EDU), A MODULAR SYSTEM THAT SECURELY COMMUNICATES WITH OTHE'R SYSTEMS, UTILIZES COMMON DATA ELEMENTS (CDES) TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL DATA EXCHANGE, RESTRICT DATA ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL AND SUPPORT A VARIETY OF FEATURES INCLUDING SPECIMEN ACQUISITION, CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANNOTATION, GENERATION OF REPORTS AND SHIPPING DOCUMENTS, SPECIMEN DATA DISTRIBUTION OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT, AND MAINTENANCE OF HIGH DATA QUALIFY BY ALERTING BIOBANK
STAFF OF OUTSTANDING TASKS FOR SPECIMENS. THE BCM INFORMATICS GROUP  WILL DETERMINE WHAT CUSTOMIZATIONS TO OUR DATABASE TO SUPPORT ACSR BIOBANKING, DATA EXTRACTION AND MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN ACSR SOP/MOO. THESE NEEDS WILL BE PRIORITIZED AND ASSIGNED TO SOFTWARE ""BUILDS,"" THAT ARE RELEASED EVERY 8-12 WEEKS OVER THE ENTIRE FUNDING
PERIOD. ALL BCM SYSTEMS UTILIZE ENCRYPTED PASSWORDS WITH VIRTUAL ACCESS LIMITED BY THE BCM FIREWALL. SERVERS  ARE HOUSED IN A HIPAA-COMPLIANT TIER ILL DATA CENTER WITH 24-HOUR ON-SITE SECURITY; ACCESS IS LIMITED TO AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITH CARD-BASED ENTRY TO THE ENCLOSED AREA. DATA ARE BACKED UP NIGHTLY TO  OFFSITE NETAPP APPLIANCES WITH LONG-TERM  STORAGE ON TAPE; SOFTWARE IS VERSIONED WITHIN A SUBVERSION REPOSITORY AND BACKED UP BIWEEKLY.

RIVER CITY CHURCH WILL COMPLETE PROJECTS TO UPGRADE NETWORK/INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENHANCE CYBERSECURITY, TO REPLACE METAL-FRAMED GLASS DOORS WITH KEY CYLINDER LOCKS, AND TO INSTALL A CARD-READER ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM. 
RIVER CITY CHURCH IS PROMINENTLY LOCATED AT THE CORNER OF BECK LANE AND US 231, NEAR THE MAJOR INTERSECTION OF IN-25 AND US 231.  THE LARGE CAMPUS INCLUDES A BUILDING WITH A HIGH-PROFILE CROSS ON TOP THAT CAN BE SEEN FROM A DISTANCE AND SEVERAL SMALLER CROSSES ON THE OUTSIDE WALLS,  CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THE BUILDING AS A CHRISTIAN HOUSE OF WORSHIP.  JUST A FEW MINUTES FROM PURDUE UNIVERSITY AIRPORT AND PURDUE UNIVERSITY, THE CHURCH'S PROXIMITY AND VISIBILITY COULD MAKE IT A POTENTIAL TARGET. 
IN 2023, RIVER CITY CHURCH RECEIVED A PHONE CALL THREATENING TO KILL TWO CHURCH STAFF MEMBERS AT THE LAFAYETTE CAMPUS (THE LAFAYETTE CAMPUS IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS GRANT PROPOSAL).  ANOTHER NEARBY RIVER CITY CHURCH CAMPUS SUFFERED A BREAK-IN ATTEMPT RESULTING IN BROKEN WINDOWS ON THE PARSONAGE. THESE ATTACKS AGAINST RIVER CITY CHURCH CAMPUSES ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF THE RISING NUMBER OF WIDESPREAD ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CHURCHES. 
VULNERABILITIES REVEALED BY RISK ASSESSMENT INCLUDE EXTERIOR DOORS HAVING DOUBLE HANDLES THAT COULD BE TIED TOGETHER, DOORS ARE MOSTLY METAL-FRAMED GLASS, NO IT INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT A FIREWALL, NO SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM IN PLACE.
THE CONTINUITY OF CARE WOULD BE DISRUPTED FOR 141 CHILDREN WHO ATTEND ADVENTURE STATION, THE DAYCARE/PRESCHOOL IN THE RIVER CITY CHURCH FACILITY.

DUE TO CHALLENGING BACKGROUNDS AND SITUATIONS OF OUR TENANTS ALONG WITH POOR COVERAGE OF THE PROPERTY WE ARE IN NEED OF SECURITY UPGRADES.  UPGRADES WILL ALLOW US TO LIMIT CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AND CONTINUE TO PROTECT & RESPOND IN A MORE ROBUST WAY TO PROTECT NOT JUST OUR TENANTS BUT OUR NEIGHBORS WHICH INCLUDE A CHILDCARE FACILITY IMMEDIATELY WEST THAT HAS CHILDCARE OPERATING HOURS UNTIL MIDNIGHT.  THIS WILL HELP US TO INCREASE OUR COMMUNITY PRESENCE AS A KNOWN LOCAL & STATE LEADER.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS LOW-MODERATE INCOME EARNERS; LOW HOMEOWNERSHIP; LOW-PERFORMING SCHOOLS, AND LITTLE TO NO SMALL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHICH OFTEN PERPETUATES CYCLES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.  THREATS OF VIOLENCE INCLUDING SHOOTINGS, SHOTS FIRED, STOLEN VEHICLES, THEFT, HOMELESSNESS, AND PROXIMITY TO DOWNTOWN HAS MADE US A SOFT TARGET.
AN ATTACK WOULD DEVASTATE AND SET US BACK TREMENDOUSLY FROM THE 30 YEARS OF WHICH WE'VE POURED INTO THE COMMUNITY.  AN ATTACK WOULD CAUSE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE MANY PEOPLE WE SERVE AND COULD CAUSE A LARGE NUMBER OF INJURIES OR CASUALTIES AS WE SERVE OVER 200 TOTAL FAMILIES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL PURCHASE AND INSTALL VIDEO CAMERAS AND DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDING DEVICES BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE STORE TO DOCUMENT ANY ACTUAL ATTACK UPON OUR EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS, CUSTOMERS, OR THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. CURRENTLY THERE IS AN INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CAMERAS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING, AND NO CAMERA IN OUR MAIN OFFICE WHERE ASSETS ARE RETAINED BEFORE THE DAILY DEPOSIT.
WE WILL PURCHASE AND INSTALL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE NEEDED TO COMMUNICATE AN ACTIVE ATTACK OR THREAT OF ATTACK TO ALL INDIVIDUALS ON OUR PREMISES AS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM OTHER THAN INTERNET ACCESS, AND LANDLINE AND CELLULAR PHONES.
WE WILL COUNTER CYBER-ATTACK THREATS THROUGH THE PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF MALWARE AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE. THIS WILL HELP DETER THE LOSS OF IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE, PASSWORDS TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION, AND/OR SIMILAR THREATS THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE OR INTERRUPT OUR CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES. CURRENTLY WE HAVE NO SOFTWARE OR PROCESSES IN PLACE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL PURCHASE AND INSTALL A COMMERCIAL GRADE FIREWALL TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST OUTSIDE CYBER ATTACKERS BY SHIELDING OUR COMPUTERS FROM MALICIOUS NETWORK TRAFFIC. CURRENTLY THERE IS ONLY A PERSONAL FIREWALL PROTECTION ON OUR COMPUTERS AT THE THRIFT STORE.
WE WILL PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION BETTER OUTDOOR LIGHTING TO PROVIDE THE BEST CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ATTACKERS ON OUR FACILITY BETWEEN DUSK AND DAWN. CURRENT LIGHTING AND CAMERAS DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT MEANS TO DO SO.
FINALLY, WE WILL PURCHASE AND INSTALL A PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM TO ALLOW OUR EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS TO PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR FACILITIES AND THE PEOPLE WITHIN FROM UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL AND ATTACK.

BY SERVING ALL WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, IDENTITY OR ORIENTATION, WE ARE VULNERABLE TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM AGAINST THE POOR, THE IMMIGRANT, AND MINORITY GROUPS.

IN AND AROUND THE BUILDING EXIST MULTIPLE POINTS OF ENTRY WITH ONLY LIMITED MEASURES OF ACCESS CONTROL, VIDEO COVERAGE, ALARMS, MASS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND LIGHTING.

THE THRIFT STORE IS LOCATED IN A LOW-INCOME, HIGH-CRIME AREA OF THE CITY. THE STORE EMPLOYS OVER 15 INDIVIDUALS AND OFFERS VOLUNTEER/SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES TO MANY.

THE CHURCH IDENTIFIED 3 TYPES OF THREATS: (1) INSIDERS, SUCH AS MEMBERS OR DAYCARE FAMILIES, WHO ARE DISENCHANTED OR UPSET WITH THE CHURCH OR DAYCARE; (2) OUTSIDERS WITH PAST TIES TO THE CHURCH, LIKE FORMER EMPLOYEES, MEMBERS, OR THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED ASSISTANCE, WHO NOW HOLD GRIEVANCES; AND (3) STRANGERS OR GROUPS OPPOSED TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, AIMING TO MAKE A ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒSTATEMENTÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ BY TARGETING THE CHURCH OR DAYCARE. RECOGNIZING THESE RISKS HELPS THE CHURCH PROACTIVELY ADDRESS SAFETY AND SECURITY.
THE POINTE CHURCH, WITH 3,000+ MEMBERS ON A HIGH-SPEED ROAD, COULD BE A TARGET FOR EXTREMISTS. ITS DAYCARE, CAREPOINTE ACADEMY, SERVES 100+ CHILDREN AND LACKS FENCING, OUTDOOR CAMERAS, AND CONSISTENT ACCESS CONTROL, WHICH IS TURNED OFF ON SUNDAYS TO REMAIN OPEN. SECURITY IS MINIMAL, WITH NO PERSONNEL, LIMITED NETWORK PROTECTION, AND OUTDATED CAMERAS. IMPROVED PLANNING, TRAINING, AND SECURITY MEASURES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO ENSURE SAFETY.
IF THE CHURCH OR ITS CHILDCARE WERE TARGETED BY EXTREMISTS, 5 EFFECTS ARE LIKELY: (1) FEAR WOULD LEAD ATTENDEES AND DAYCARE FAMILIES TO LEAVE; (2) THE DISRUPTION COULD BANKRUPT AND SHUT DOWN THE ORGANIZATION; (3) LEADERSHIP MIGHT LOSE RESPECT IN THE COMMUNITY FOR FAILING TO PREVENT THE ATTACK; (4) SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED AS THE PUBLIC AVOIDS CHURCHES AND CHILDCARES; AND (5) BOTH THE CHURCH AND CHILDCARE WOULD SUFFER DUE TO THEIR INTERTWINED REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL DEPENDENCE.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_EMW-2024-UA-05084_070/,2024-12-09 00:00:00+00

PROJECT BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR SUBAWARD
CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE ARE CRUCIAL TIMES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY SKELETAL AND 
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEMS. CHILDREN WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) ARE PLAGUED BY 
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, ANEMIA, AND BONE DISEASE, WITH FRACTURES RATES THAT ARE 2- TO 3-FOLD 
HIGHER THAN IN HEALTHY CHILDREN. FURTHERMORE, MORE THAN 50% OF ADULTS WHO DEVELOPED KIDNEY 
DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD REPORT SKELETAL SYMPTOMS, WITH 20% REPORTING HANDICAPS FROM THEIR BONE 
DISEASE, DESPITE TREATMENT WITH PHOSPHATE BINDERS AND ACTIVE VITAMIN D CONSEQUENCE OF A 
LIFELONG PROCESS. CURRENTLY, THERE IS A LACK OF LARGE-SCALE DATABASES CONTAINING DATA FROM DEEP 
PHENOTYPING OF PATIENTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF ROD. THIS PROPOSAL WILL GENERATE A BIOREPOSITORY 
OF HUMAN BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS AND THE ACCOMPANYING ANALYTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ESSENTIAL FOR 
REDEFINING, ELUCIDATING AND CHARACTERIZING THE PATHOGENESIS OF ROD IN CKD PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 
WITH AND WITHOUT DIALYSIS AND INFORMING THE DEVELOPING OF NOVEL DISEASE MODIFYING OR 
PREVENTATIVE THERAPIES.
BONE BIOPSY
BONE BIOPSY WILL BE PERFORMED IN THOSE PATIENTS THAT WILL AGREE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. AFTER 
DOUBLE TETRACYCLINE LABELING, THE SPECIMEN OF BONE WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A BORDIER BONE BIOPSY

Uncovering and quantifying the multi-way relationship across modalities, including environ- mental, *omics, imaging, and neurocognitive data, will help better understand the mechanisms behind complex diseases, such as the impact of substance abuse on neurodevelopment and Alzheimer's Disease. Considering genetic, demographic, and phenotypic traits, it is crucial to characterize disease heterogeneity, such as sex- related differences, for precision medicine. Though methods to perform longitudinal and path analysis of univari- ate data can be applied to individual data elements, limited methods are available directly for data with structured constraints and integrated analysis of large datasets. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methodologies to analyze longitudinal high-dimensional data with mathematical constraints and novel generalized path analysis methodologies to integrate complex data collected from multiple sources, with appli- cation to the study of neurodevelopment/neurodegeneration and related mental disorders. The overall objective is to elucidate longitudinal effects on brain structure and function, to characterize population heterogeneity, to understand the role of different modalities and mechanisms, and to provide guidance on personalized early prevention/intervention strategies. The challenges of longitudinal integrated mechanistic modeling of multiview data include (i) longitudinal modeling of variables with complex structure (e.g. positive denite matrices), (ii) high dimensionality and heterogeneity, (iii) delineation of multiple pathways, and (iv) development of large-scale and computationally efcient algorithms. To address these, three specic aims are proposed: (1) develop novel regression frameworks for multiple longitudinal, high-dimensional covariance matrix outcomes with predictors across modalities; (2) develop big-data path analysis with longitudinal, high-dimensional, complex variables; (3) develop statistical methodologies to characterize individual growth trajectories of complex variables. Aim 1 introduces longitudinal models with covariance matrices as the outcome to investigate changes in data struc- ture and/or characteristics at a network level. Aim 2 innovates path regularization and integrated optimization criteria for high-dimensional structured data to identify markers and search for causal pathways under longitudi- nal settings. Aim 3 develops methodologies to guide personalized prevention/intervention strategies. To foster dissemination, repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability of scientic ndings, open-source software will be developed. The proposed research is innovative because it proposes methodologies to perform longitudinal and path analysis for high-dimensional data with complex and specic structures collected from multiple domains. The proposed research is signicant because it will enrich the understanding of the human brain and guide practitioners to promote well-being in adolescent and elderly populations.",93.242: MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH GRANTS,sub-grant,CC9D8492-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,12,9955,37345.00,2024-12-17,2025,GM1XX56LEP58,042250712,"TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, THE",INDIANA UNIVERSITY INDIANAPOLIS,GM1XX56LEP58,042250712,"TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, THE",USA,United States,3451 WALNUT ST STE 440A,PHILADELPHIA,PA,PENNSYLVANIA,191046205,PA-03,PA-03,,"PRIVATE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE,HOSPITAL,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION",PHILADELPHIA,PA,PENNSYLVANIA,191046205.0,PA-03,PA-03,USA,United States,"AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA (UPENN), COLLECTION AND FEDERATED ANALYSIS OF ALL COLLECTED DIGITAL BREAST

WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE OPEN-SOURCE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS) AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FDA REGULATORY
SCIENCE BIOEQUIVALENCE DATA TO GENERATE BOTH MANUAL TRAINING DATA (I.E. EXAMPLES OF INPUTS AND DESIRED OUTPUTS) AS
WELL AS SYNTHETIC, AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED TRAINING DATA BY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LLMS. WE WILL USE THESE TO BUILD SPECIAL
PURPOSE LLMS WITH SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES OF USE TO FDA BE REVIEWERS. THERE IS ALREADY SOME PRECEDENT FOR USING THESE
APPROACHES FOR ACHIEVING GOOD PERFORMANCE ON TEXTUAL SUMMARIZATION, DETECTION OF DISCREPANCIES.
THE ANALYSIS OF TABULAR DATA IS JUST EMERGING FOR LLMS, BUT EARLY REPORTS SUGGEST STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACHES THAT TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF CAPABILITIES OF LLMS FOR TEXT. THE ANALYSIS OF IMAGES IS THE MOST RISKY/CHALLENGING PART OF THIS WORK; WE
WILL WORK WITH FDA COLLABORATORS TO TEXT EMERGING ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒMULTI-MODALÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ FOUNDATION MODELS THAT ARE OPEN SOURCE AND CAN BE
FINE-TUNED USING SPECIFIC DATA OF INTEREST TO THE FDA (E.G. PK CURVES). WE WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH FDA SCIENTISTS
AND THE STANFORD CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON FOUNDATION MODELS TO PROTOTYPE THESE TOOLS, CREATE EVALUATION SETS, PUBLISH
OUR RESULTS, AND TRANSFER ASSETS TO FDA FOR INTERNAL USE/TESTING.
THE FDA CALL FOR PROPOSALS OUTLINED SEVERAL CAPABILITIES:
1. SUMMARIZATION: THE CFP GAVE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF SUMMARIZATION TASKS (BE STUDY SUMMARIZED TO 10 KEY
POINTS, ADME PROPERTIES OF A DRUG, CRITICAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES FOR DRUG). THESE SHOULD BE WELL-WITHIN THE CAPABILITIES OF A
FINE-TUNED LLM. THE KEY CHALLENGE WILL BE ENGINEERING THE APPROPRIATE PROMPTS, PROVIDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA WITH
WHICH TO FINE-TUNE THE LLM, AND EVALUATION OF HALLUCINATION TENDENCIES.
2. NLP APPLICATION TO EXTRACT/ORGANIZE INFORMATION FROM IMAGES. THIS IS MORE CHALLENGING SINCE THE ANALYSIS OF
IMAGES REQUIRES NOT AN LLM BUT A ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒFOUNDATION MODELÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ (FM) WHICH COMBINES TEXT AND IMAGE. PART OF OUR PROPOSAL
THEREFORE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING DATA FOR THIS TASK (PAIRED IMAGES AND INTERPRETATIONS) AND THE
VOLUME OF THESE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL EXPERIMENT WITH AVAILABLE MULTI-MODAL FMS TO ASSESS THEIR CAPABILITIES IN
EXTRACTING PHARMACOKINETIC DATA FROM IMAGES. FOR EXAMPLE, MACAW-LLM PROVIDES AN OPEN-SOURCE ARCHITECTURE FOR
TEXT, IMAGE, AUDIO AND VIDEO WHICH WE CAN EVALUATE [5]. THERE ARE OTHER SUCH PLATFORMS EMERGING THAT WE WILL
EVALUATE.
3. NLP CAPTURE OF INFORMATION IN TABLES IN WORD/PDF. THIS IS AN EMERGING AREA WITH SOME REPORTS OF INITIAL
PROGRESS [6]. REMARKABLY, THE BEST WAY FOR PROCESSING TEXT IS OFTEN TO TURN IT INTO TEXT SENTENCE ASSERTIONS, AND THEN
FEED IT AS A QUERY INTO THE LLM FOR ANALYSIS. WE WILL EXPERIMENT WITH THIS STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH AFTER USING UTILITY
CODE/SOFTWARE TO EXTRACT THE TABLES IN STRUCTURED FORM AND THEN CREATE THE SENTENCES FROM THE TABLE FOR INPUT INTO THE
LLM.
4. CROSS CHECKING SUBMITTED DATA IN DIFFERENT FORMS: THE LLMS SHOULD BE GOOD AT IDENTIFYING DISCREPANCIES IN THE
DATA BECAUSE THIS WILL BE ENTIRELY TEXT BASED (ONCE WE SOLVE CHALLENGE
(3) WITH TURNING TABLES INTO TEXT), BUT HALLUCINATION WILL BE THE MAIN ISSUE TO EVALUATE.
WE RECOGNIZE THE CONSTRAINTS ON THIS PROJECT, PARTICULARLY THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE USE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA, THAT THE
RESULTING MODELS BE COMPATIBLE WITH RUNNING LOCALLY ON FDA SERVERS INSIDE THE FIREWALL, AND THE NEED TO PUBLISH OUR
RESULTS COLLABORATIVE WITH FDA SCIENTISTS, IDEALLY WITH THE PUBLIC DATA SETS TO ENCOURAGE PROGRESS IN THIS FIELD. TO THAT
END, IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO USE PRECISIONFDA AS A PLATFORM FOR COMPETITIVE EVALUATIONS OF CAPABILITIESÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ESPECIALLY
THOSE THAT SEEM DIFFICULT OR FOR WHICH THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES.
WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE FDA WITH EXCELLENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF LLMS FOR SUPPORT OF REGULATORY DECISION MAKING.

Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible vision loss from advanced AMD stages such as geographic atrophy (GA). Patients at higher risk of progression to GA would benefit from more frequent follow up visits, low vision referrals, and administration of therapeutic interventions. Deep learning (DL) techniques have recently been applied to diagnose, classify, and understand the progression trends of GA. However, a major limitation of DL is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets from a diverse sub-population for robust diagnostic or prognostic performance. Due to the overfitting on training data, the model tends to perform badly on external data (less generalizability of the model). Moreover, efforts towards large public centralized datasets for DL research are hindered by significant barriers to data sharing, privacy concerns, costs of image de-identification, and controls over how data would be used. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of novel federated DL approaches, which enable gaining insights collaboratively, e.g., in the form of a consensus model, without moving patient data beyond the firewalls of the institutions in which they reside. This novel paradigm of DL model training focuses on distributing the training of DL models across institutions instead of sharing patient data and only the model parameters are shared with a central server. We specifically seek to build robust risk models for predicting the occurrence and growth of GA. Four data cohorts from the Stanford University, University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), Wake Forest University (Wake Forest), and National Taiwan University (NTU) will be used to test the hypothesis that the prognostic accuracy of the GA risk models using federated approach is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets. Our first aim is to establish a federated learning (FL) framework for GA prediction utilizing longitudinal multi-modal imaging and patient meta-data from four independent institutions (training and independent testing dataset from Stanford, UIC, Wake Forest, and NTU). Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate a robust and secure FL framework for GA risk model training within the multi-institutional environment. The second aim is to integrate a novel adversarial domain alignment (ADA) technique into the FL framework to tackle domain shift caused by heterogeneous data distribution at different institutions. To improve data representation learning, and model transferability and generalizability across sub-population data, a novel self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) based methods will be employed within the FL framework. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to establish protocols for integrating domain alignment into FL framework and evaluate the FL- trained GA prediction models deployed on new and previously unseen clinical data. Clinical deployment of such AI prediction tools will facilitate identification of high-risk AMD patients as candidates for more frequent screening and earlier treatment, leading to better clinical outcomes.",93.867: VISION RESEARCH,sub-grant,BC1B85CE-5784-415A-832C-B5F9DD35B312,2025,6,20231025-01-WFU,47943.00,2025-06-06,2025,SN7KD2UK7GC5,937727907,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,,N8DMK1K4C2K5,,THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,USA,UNITED STATES,MEDICAL CENTER BLVD,WINSTON SALEM,NC,NORTH CAROLINA,27157-0001,NC-05,NC-10,,"PRIVATE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE,NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION,BUSINESS OR ORGANIZATION,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION",CHARLOTTE,,,28223,NORTH CAROLINA 12,,,UNITED STATES,"THIS PROJECT AIMS TO LEVERAGE MULTI-MODAL (IMAGING AND META-DATA) FEDERATED LEARNING (FL) FOR DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS TO PREDICT PROGRESSION OF GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY (GA) IN PATIENTS WITH AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD). SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF USING NOVEL FEDERATED DEEP LEARNING (DL) APPROACHES IN WIDE-SPREAD DEPLOYMENT OF GA PREDICTION TOOLS. FEDERATED LEARNING ENABLES DATA TO REMAIN WITHIN INSTITUTIONS BUT SHARES MODEL PARAMETERS WITH A CENTRAL SERVER, SHIFTING THE PARADIGM ON DL RESEARCH ON AMD MANAGEMENT. 
AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF SEVERE VISION LOSS. EARLY DETECTION, PROMPT INTERVENTION, AND RELIABLE ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT OUTCOMES ARE ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT IRREVERSIBLE VISUAL LOSS FROM ADVANCED AMD STAGES SUCH AS GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY (GA). PATIENTS AT HIGHER RISK OF PROGRESSION TO GA OR GA GROWTH WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE FREQUENT FOLLOW UP VISITS AND ADMINISTRATION OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS ALONG WITH LOW VISION REFERRALS. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AL) ALGORITHMS LIKE DEEP LEARNING (DL) HAVE RECENTLY BEEN APPLIED TO DIAGNOSE, CLASSIFY, AND UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESSION TRENDS OF AMD. A MAJOR LIMITATION OF DL, HOWEVER, IS THE NEED FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF WELL CURATED DATASETS. OTHER LIMITATIONS INCLUDE OVERFITTING AND ""BRITTLENESS"" THAT CAN CAUSE MODEL PERFORMANCE TO DROP ON EXTERNAL DATA (LESS GENERALIZABILITY OF THE MODEL). MOREOVER, THERE ARE NUMEROUS BARRIERS TO BUILDING AND HOSTING THESE LARGE CENTRAL REPOSITORIES WITH MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL DATA REQUIRED FOR ROBUST DL, INCLUDING CONCERNS ABOUT DATA SHARING, REGULATORY ISSUES, PATIENT PRIVACY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IN THIS PROJECT, WE AIM TO DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF NOVEL DISTRIBUTED/FEDERATED DL APPROACHES, WHICH ENABLE GAINING INSIGHTS COLLABORATIVELY, E.G., IN THE FORM OF A CONSENSUS MODEL, WITHOUT MOVING PATIENT DATA BEYOND THE FIREWALLS OF THE INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH THEY RESIDE. FOUR DATA COHORTS FROM THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS CHICAGO (UIC), WAKE FOREST ATRIUM EYE CENTER (WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES), AND NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY (NTU) WILL BE USED TO VALIDATE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RISK MODELS USING FEDERATED APPROACH IS MORE ROBUST THAN MODELS BUILT ON SINGLE INSTITUTIONAL DATASETS. 
PROJECT GOAL 
WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS AND ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 
AIM 1: TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF DOMAIN ADAPTIVE FEDERATED APPROACHES FOR GA PREDICTION USING MULTI­MODAL AND LONGITUDINAL PATIENT DATA. IN THIS AIM, WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH AN FL FRAMEWORK FOR GA PREDICTION UTILIZING MULTI-MODAL IMAGING (OCT) AND PATIENT META-DATA FROM THREE INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS (STANFORD, UIC, AND WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY; YEAR 1). WE WILL INTEGRATE A NOVEL ADVERSARIAL DOMAIN ALIGNMENT (ADA) TECHNIQUE INTO THE FL FRAMEWORK TO TACKLE DOMAIN SHIFT CAUSED BY HETEROGENEOUS DATA DISTRIBUTION AT DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS. ADA CAN GENERALIZE THE DOMAIN VARIANT DATA INTO A COMMON SPACE OF TARGET DATA, ENHANCING THE GENERALIZABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF FL-TRAINED MODELS. WE WILL FURTHER EMPLOY SELF-SUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE LEARNING (CL) TO IMPROVE MODEL TRANSFERABILITY AND GENERALIZABILITY ACROSS SUB-POPULATION DATA. KEY SUCCESS CRITERION OF THE AIM 1 STUDY IS TO DEMONSTRATE A ROBUST, DOMAIN-ADAPTIVE, AND SECURE FEDERATED FRAMEWORK FOR GA RISK MODEL TRAINING WITHIN THREE INSTITUTIONS AND ESTABLISH PROTOCOLS FOR INTEGRATING DOMAIN ALIGNMENT INTO FL FRAMEWORKS.
AIM 2: TO EXPAND THE FL CONSORTIUM AND VALIDATE THE FL FRAMEWORKS FOR GA PREDICTION ON NEW RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL DATA. IN THIS AIM, WE WILL EXPAND THE FL CONSORTIUM TO ONE NEW INSTITUTION (NTU) AND VALIDATE FL-TRAINED GA RISK PREDICTION MODELS ON DATA FROM THAT INSTITUTION (YEAR 2). THE FRAMEWORK AND GA PROGRESSION ALGORITHM WILL BE PACKAGED IN A SOFTWARE WITH EASY USER-INTERFACE THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED IN ANY NEW ADDITION TO THIS FL CONSORTIUM.
