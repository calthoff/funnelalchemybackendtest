SECTION A: BACKGROUND AND IDENTIFICATION OF NEEDS

 THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY (MDPS), THE PARENT AGENCY OF THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL INFORMATION CENTER (MCIC), IS THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR CRIMINAL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. THE MCIC IS MISSISSIPPIS PRIMARY CONDUIT FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITH THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS (FBI) NATIONAL CRIMINAL INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) SYSTEM, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER NATIONAL DATA EXCHANGES AND STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITHIN MISSISSIPPI. 

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

 OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE MDPS-MCIC, THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI HAS BUILT A STATE-OF-THE-ART CRIMINAL RECORDS SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM, THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM (MCHS) WAS CREATED USING FUNDING FROM FEDERAL GRANTS INCLUDING NATIONAL CRIMINAL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (NCHIP) FUNDS, EDWARD BYRNE MEMORIAL GRANT FUNDS, AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED BY THE STATE. THESE FUNDS HAVE PROVIDED THE CORE CAPABILITIES OF A SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (IAFIS), THE STATE MESSAGE SWITCH FOR ROUTING OF MESSAGES INCLUDING NCIC/NLETS MESSAGES, THE STATE NCIC TERMINAL APPLICATION SERVER, THE MCHS REPOSITORY, AUTOMATIC PROCESSING OF INTERSTATE IDENTIFICATION INDEX (III) SUPPORT, A TRANSACTION ARCHIVE AND A ROBUST SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. THESE SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS WERE CONSTRUCTED USING BEST PRACTICES IN THE AREAS OF COMPUTING HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND OPEN INTERFACE STANDARDS.

 THE MCIC CONTINUES TO EMPLOY PROVEN STRATEGIES IN DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND DEPLOYMENT IMPROVEMENTS. TODAY, BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS NCHIP FUNDING, MISSISSIPPIS NCIC SYSTEM IS CENTERED AROUND THE MCHS REPOSITORY BASED ON OPEN STANDARDS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE MCIC HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO MAKE BROAD IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS SYSTEMS AND QUALITY OF DATA BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS NCHIP FUNDING, STATE FUNDING, AND OTHER FEDERAL GRANT RESOURCES. THESE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE:


	A DEVELOPED PROCESS FOR ENTRY AND VERIFICATION OF INTERSTATE IDENTIFICATION INDEX (III) ENTRIES WITH PARTICIPATING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. THIS IS A CONTINUOUS EFFORT BY THE MISSISSIPPI JUSTICE INFORMATION CENTER (MJIC) TO IMPROVE THE TIMELINESS AND QUALITY OF SUBMISSIONS AND ACTIVE RECORDS ON THE III FILE; 
	MISSISSIPPI PARTICIPATES IN NICS INSTANT BACKGROUND CHECKS WITH CRIMINAL DATA. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI PASSED LEGISLATION IN MARCH 2013 REQUIRING MDPS TO REPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH DISPOSITIONS THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY A CANDIDATE FROM RECEIVING A FIREARMS PERMIT TO NICS/FBI. FUNDING SOLICITATION WAS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED UNDER THE IMPROVING THE COMPLETENESS OF FIREARM BACKGROUND CHECKS THROUGH ENHANCED STATE DATA SHARING FY 2013 COMPETITIVE GRANT ANNOUNCEMENT. MDPS HAS IMPLEMENTED A WEB-BASED APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS COURT PERSONNEL TO ENTER THE DISQUALIFYING MENTAL HEALTH ADJUDICATION AT THE TIME JUDGMENT IS RENDERED. MDPS CONTINUES TO WORK WITH COURTS TO IMPROVE THE TIMELINESS OF SUBMITTING NICS EXCLUSION INFORMATION.
	MCIC CONTINUES TO WORK WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND COURTS TO IMPLEMENT SUBMISSION OF FINAL CASE DISPOSITIONS WITH ALL OF MISSISSIPPIS COURTS.
	MISSISSIPPI CONTINUES TO UPGRADE AND ENHANCE ITS INTEGRATED AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (IAFIS) AND IS FINALIZING EFFORTS TO COMPLETE A MAJOR UPGRADE OF THE IAFIS SOLUTION THAT WILL INCREASE THE DATABASE CAPACITY FOR FINGERPRINT AND TRANSACTION VOLUME ALONG WITH ACCURACY AND WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENTS THAT MEET THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY FEATURES AVAILABLE FOR THESE TYPE SYSTEMS;
	MCIC PERSONNEL, IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONTRACTORS, ACTIVELY REVIEW SYSTEMS DATA BY PROBING AND MINING FOR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS IN THE TYPE AND QUALITY OF DATA.
	THE MCIC CONTINUES TO COLLABORATE WITH THE STATES COURTS TO IMPROVE FINAL DISPOSITION SUBMISSIONS TO THE REPOSITORY.
	THE MCIC AND THE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE (AGO) JOINTLY OPERATE A STATEWIDE REGISTRY OF UNIFORM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPORTING. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI HAS A STATE REPOSITORY FOR PROTECTION ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM THAT INTERFACES TO THE FBIS NATIONAL PROTECTION ORDER FILE.


PROGRESS ON RECORD IMPROVEMENT GOALS:

 THE MDPS/MCIC CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF COURTS AS THE PROTECTION ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM AND THE ABILITY TO FORWARD PROTECTION ORDERS TO THE NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE IMPLEMENTED. 

 CURRENT STATUS IN SPECIFIC SUBJECT AREAS:


	DISPOSITION AVAILABLE TO III: MISSISSIPPI PARTICIPATES IN SENDING CASE DISPOSITIONS TO THE FBI VIA THE III DSP MESSAGE KEY. THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM (MCHS) VENDOR HAS MODIFIED THE SYSTEMS PROCESS THAT WILL ALLOW MS TO TAKE TEMPORARY OWNERSHIP OF THE RECORD AND UPDATE THE DISPOSITION IN IAFIS. WITH THE MODIFIED PROCESS IN PLACE, A PREEXISTING BACKLOG OF REJECTED DSP MESSAGES THAT ACCUMULATED SINCE GOING LIVE HAS BEEN UPDATED AND SENT TO THE FBI. 


 UPON RECEIVING NOTIFICATION FROM THE FBI THAT THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPIS DISPOSITION REPORTING RATE WAS LOW, THE MS CRIMINAL INFORMATION CENTERS (MCIC) MANAGEMENT TEAM COMMUNICATED WITH THE COURT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE STATE REQUESTING DISPOSITION INFORMATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN SENT TO MCIC FOR PROCESSING. MCIC HAS STARTED RECEIVING MUCH OF THE MISSING DISPOSITION INFORMATION. MOST OF THE CORRESPONDENCE IS BEING PERFORMED THROUGH PAPER EXCHANGE, MAINLY MAILING AND FAXING WITH POSTING BY MCIC RECORDS TECHNICIANS. 

 THE MCIC MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COURT PERSONNEL TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE MEANS OF DISPOSITION SUBMISSION PROCESSING. 


	NICS INDEX AND MENTAL HEALTH RECORD AVAILABILITY: PREVIOUS MISSISSIPPI LAWS PROHIBITED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH RECORD CHECKS IN NICS; THEREFORE THE STATE HAD NO STATEWIDE DATABASE OF ADJUDICATED MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI PASSED LEGISLATION IN MARCH 2013 ALLOWING THE MDPS TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE MENTAL HEALTH DISPOSITIONS THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY A CANDIDATE FROM RECEIVING A FIREARMS OR FIREARM PERMITS TO NICS/FBI. FUNDING SOLICITATION WAS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED UNDER THE IMPROVING THE COMPLETENESS OF FIREARM BACKGROUND CHECKS THROUGH ENHANCED STATE DATA SHARING FY 2013 COMPETITIVE GRANT ANNOUNCEMENT. MDPS HAS IMPLEMENTED A WEB-BASED APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS COURT PERSONNEL TO ENTER THE DISQUALIFYING MENTAL HEALTH ADJUDICATION AT THE TIME JUDGMENT IS RENDERED. 
	PROTECTION ORDER FILES: THE MCIC HAS WORKED WITH THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HAS IMPLEMENTED A COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM PROVIDED BY 2008 SDVRIP GRANT FUNDING, FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN IN-STATE PROTECTION ORDER REGISTRY SYSTEM THAT FORWARDS PROTECTION ORDERS TO THE NATIONAL SYSTEM. 
	WARRANTS/WANTED PERSON RECORDS: THE MCIC DOES SUBMIT INFORMATION FOR INCLUSION IN THE FBIS NCIC WANTED PERSONS FILE. 


 WHILE THE MDPS/MCIC HAS BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE ITS ABILITY TO EMPLOY PROVEN STRATEGIES IN THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND DEPLOYMENT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN ITS CRIMINAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SINCE INCEPTION; THE AGENCY FINDS THE NEED FOR THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF INTEREST TO: 


	CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) TO PROVIDE AN UPGRADE TO THE CONFIGURATOR FROM 6.5  7.5 AS PART OF A REQUIRED PREREQUISITE FOR THE XML N3G UPGRADE FOR SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETYS (MDPS) STATE MESSAGE SWITCH. 
	CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) IMPLEMENT THE DATAMAXX SESSION MODIFICATIONS TO MODIFY THE SERVER TO PROCESS CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO THE DAC STATIONS.
	CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT DQ (DRIVER LICENSE QUERY)/KQ (DRIVER HISTORY QUERY) RESPONSE TO CONFIGURE THE TWO-MESSAGE KEY.


MANY IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE STATES CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM HAVE BEEN DUE, IN PART, TO A COMBINATION OF PREVIOUS NCHIP GRANTS, AS WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING. WITHOUT SUCH FUNDING, THE AGENCY CANNOT FINANCIALLY UNDERTAKE PROJECTS OF THIS MAGNITUDE. AT THE PRESENT TIME, NO LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE AGENCY TO CONTINUE THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. PREVIOUS NCHIP FUNDING OBTAINED BY MDPS HAS ALL BEEN OBLIGATED, THEREFORE, EXTERNAL RESOURCES SUCH AS THE FY2021 NCHIP FUNDING IS SOUGHT TO ASSIST THE MDPS IN FULFILLING ITS COMMITMENT TO ONGOING IMPROVEMENT OF MISSISSIPPIS CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM. THE GOAL OF THE MDPS IS TO ENHANCE THE STATES CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM TO IMPROVE DATA QUALITY, DATA EXCHANGE PROCESSES AND DATA AVAILABILITY TO NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. 

SECTION B: PROJECT DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION: DESCRIPTION OF TASKS TO BE FUNDED UNDER NCHIP

 THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY (MDPS) REQUESTS BJS FY 2021 NATIONAL CRIMINAL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (NCHIP) FUNDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING NEEDED SUPPLEMENTAL PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT THAT WILL ENABLE THE AGENCY TO:


	CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) TO PROVIDE A APPLICATION SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETYS (MDPS) STATE MESSAGE SWITCH.


CONTRACT WITH CPI TO PROVIDE AN APPLICATION SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE CONFIGURATOR FROM 6.7 TO 7.5 AS PART OF THE MDPS STATE MESSAGE SWITCH. ($273,050.00): MDPS IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO CONTRACT WITH CPI TO PROVIDE AN APPLICATION SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE CONFIGURATOR FROM 6.5 TO 7.5 AS PART OF THE MDPS STATE MESSAGE SWITCH UPGRADE, WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE FOR UPGRADING THE MESSAGE SWITCH WITH XML N3G. CPI WILL PROVIDE NATIONAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE MODEL (NIEM) CONFIGURATIONS ALONG WITH MESSAGE KEY TRANSFORMATION OF ALL THE NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) KEYS AND APPLY THEM TO ALL INBOUND AND OUTBOUND NCIC MESSAGES.

 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS PERFORMED THROUGH MCIC ARE REQUIRED FOR OCCUPATIONS SUCH AS TEACHERS, BANKERS, CASINO WORKERS, PHYSICIANS, PHARMACISTS, THERAPIST, NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS PLUS A RANGE OF OTHER AUTHORIZED PROFESSIONS. MCIC ALSO ALLOWS BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED ON INDIVIDUALS APPLYING FOR GUN PERMITS OR PURCHASING WEAPONS TO PREVENT CANDIDATES WITH CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH ADJUDICATIONS FROM ATTAINING A FIREARM PERMIT. IN ALL THESE CASES IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT DISPOSITIONS BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE EVALUATING APPLICANT BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ENSURE CITIZENS ARE NOT DISALLOWED OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON MISSING INFORMATION. MCIC IS CURRENTLY WORKING CPI TO BECOME COMPLIANT WITH THE NLETS MANDATE TO SUNSET LEGACY, NON-STANDARD DOT DELIMITED TEXT FORMATS. HAVING CPI TO UPGRADE THE APPLICATION SYSTEM WOULD BE THE FINAL PIECE FOR THE XML PROJECT. THIS WOULD BRING THE STATE TO FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE NLETS MANDATE IS DEPENDENT ON THE IN-STATE REPOSITORIES OR ENDPOINTS AND IS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL WORK FROM CPI, THE STATE, AND/OR THIRD-PARTY.

CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) IMPLEMENT THE DATAMAXX SESSION MODIFICATIONS TO MODIFY THE SERVER TO PROCESS CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO THE DAC STATIONS. ($20,000).

MDPS IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT THE DATAMAXX SESSION MODIFICATIONS PROJECT FOR THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. CPI WILL CPI WILL MODIFY THE DMPP-2020 INTERFACE CODE TO DETECT THE ADDITION OR MODIFICATION OF ASSOCIATED DEVICE ADDRESS CODE (DAC) STATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A SERVER CLASS STATION USING THE INTERFACE. THIS CHANGE WILL ADD LOGIC THAT WILL ALLOW DAC STATIONS TO BE ADDED OR REMOVED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR THE CUSTOMER TO SET THE SERVERS DOWN TO RECOGNIZE THOSE CHANGES.

CPI WILL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS AND/OR SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION: MODIFY THE DATAMAXX SERVER (DMXSRV) INTERFACE CODE TO PROCESS CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO DAC STATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED OR DELETED FROM AN ALREADY LOGGED ON SERVER (SRVR) CLASS STATION CONTROLLED BY THE DMXSRV INTERFACE I.E. AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THE LIST OF DAC STATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXISTING SRVR.

CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT DQ (DRIVER LICENSE QUERY)/KQ (DRIVER HISTORY QUERY) RESPONSE TO CONFIGURE THE TWO-MESSAGE KEY. ($16,950.00)

MDPS IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT THE DRIVER LICENSE QUERY AND THE DRIVER HISTORY QUERY WHICH WILL CONFIGURE DRIVERS LICENSE QUERY (DQX) AND DRIVER HISTORY QUERY (KQX) MKE ASCOPIES OF THE CURRENT DRIVERS LICENSE QUERY (DQ) AND DRIVER HISTORY QUERY (KQ) REMOVE ALL FILE ROUTES FROM DQX AND KQX EXCEPT FOR THE DMVWS FILE ROUTE MODIFY OPENFOX MESSAGE SWITCH PROCESSING FOR DRIVERS LICENSE RESPONSE (DR) AND DRIVER HISTORY RESPONSE (KR).

 IF FUNDS ARE AWARDED, THE AFOREMENTIONED PROJECTS WOULD ASSIST IN THE PRIORITY AREAS OF GRANT FUNDING BY ASSISTING MDPS IN BETTER MEETING DISPOSITION ACCURACY, TIMELINESS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS.


	CONTRACTUAL: THE MCIC INTERIM DIRECTOR, MCIC INTERIM DEPUTY DIRECTOR, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS) DIRECTOR, AND MCIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT MANAGER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE APPLICATION SYSTEM UPGRADE TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT PROCESS. THIS GROUP WILL OVERSEE, CONCURRENTLY AND AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS, THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE PROJECT BEING UNDERTAKEN WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI).


COURTS: MDPS IS NOT REQUESTING FUNDING FOR COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF COURTS TO ENHANCE THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL INFORMATION SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. THE PROJECT PROPOSED FOR FUNDING WILL INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL PERSONNEL TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS OF DISPOSITIONS POSTED TO ARREST RECORDS. THE IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE SEAMLESS TO THE COURTS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF COURTS (AOC) IS AWARE OF MDPS/MCICS EFFORTS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE AOCS LETTER OFFICIALLY DECLINING PARTICIPATION IS PROVIDED AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THIS GRANT APPLICATION.

SECTION C: CAPABILITIES AND COMPETENCIES - COORDINATION

 THE MISSISSIPPI OFFICE OF HOMELAND SECURITY (MOHS) IS A SUBDIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. THE MOHS HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION TO THE STATE'S LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES AS WELL AS TO OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, ESPECIALLY DURING CRISIS SITUATIONS. THE MCICS RESOURCES, AS WELL AS ARREST AND DISPOSITION INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO MOHS AND IN TURN TO LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES.

 THOUGH THE AFOREMENTIONED PROJECT SUBMITTED FOR FUNDING DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COURT SYSTEMS, MDPS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE MISSISSIPPI ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF COURTS (AOC) TO IDENTIFY ANY AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT AS WELL AS NEW, INNOVATIVE WAYS OF INFORMATION SHARING. IN ADDITION, AS THE STATE'S LEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, THE MDPS WILL BE WORKING WITH OTHER STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, COUNTY SHERIFF OFFICES, AND MUNICIPAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THESE STAKEHOLDERS' NEEDS WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT.

 ACTIVITIES DETAILED FOR THE 2021 NCHIP PROGRAM WILL BE COORDINATED WITH CURRENT AND PREVIOUS RECORDS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. THE GOAL OF THE MCIC IS TO PROVIDE A SINGLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR ALL LEVELS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS BOTH WITHIN THE STATE AND THROUGH NCIC/NLETS TO OTHER STATE AND NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES. AN ATTACHMENT TO THIS APPLICATION INCLUDES A MEMO SUBMITTED TO THE STATE'S TECHNOLOGY POINT-OF-CONTACT (POC) DETAILING OUR PLANS FOR THE 2021NCHIP PROJECT.

UNEXPENDED FUNDS: PREVIOUSLY AWARDED A GRANT MODIFICATION FOR NCHIP 2018 FUNDED PROJECTS ARE IN PROCESS. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WAS AWARDED $1,308,382.00 IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE OUTLINED PROJECTS. THE NCHIP 2018 PROJECTS ARE IN THE PROCUREMENT PHASES BUT THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES DELAYING THE PROJECTS.


	PURCHASED EQUIPMENT TO BETTER MANAGE THE SUPPORT AND SECURITY OF THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL INFORMATION CENTER NETWORK.


THE MDPS HAS PURCHASED AND INSTALLED IN A REDUNDANT CONFIGURATION THAT WILL ALLOW AUTOMATIC, UNATTENDED FAILOVER IF ONE OF THE UNITS GOES OFFLINE FOR ANY REASON. THE CHECK POINT DEVICES ARE MANAGED THROUGH A STANDARD WEB INTERFACE AND HAVE GREATLY ENHANCED LOGGING FOR SECURITY MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE.

SECTION A: BACKGROUND AND IDENTIFICATION OF NEEDS

 THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY (MDPS), THE PARENT AGENCY OF THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL INFORMATION CENTER (MCIC), IS THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR CRIMINAL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. THE MCIC IS MISSISSIPPIS PRIMARY CONDUIT FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITH THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS (FBI) NATIONAL CRIMINAL INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) SYSTEM, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER NATIONAL DATA EXCHANGES AND STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITHIN MISSISSIPPI. 

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

 OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE MDPS-MCIC, THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI HAS BUILT A STATE-OF-THE-ART CRIMINAL RECORDS SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM, THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM (MCHS) WAS CREATED USING FUNDING FROM FEDERAL GRANTS INCLUDING NATIONAL CRIMINAL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (NCHIP) FUNDS, EDWARD BYRNE MEMORIAL GRANT FUNDS, AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED BY THE STATE. THESE FUNDS HAVE PROVIDED THE CORE CAPABILITIES OF A SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (IAFIS), THE STATE MESSAGE SWITCH FOR ROUTING OF MESSAGES INCLUDING NCIC/NLETS MESSAGES, THE STATE NCIC TERMINAL APPLICATION SERVER, THE MCHS REPOSITORY, AUTOMATIC PROCESSING OF INTERSTATE IDENTIFICATION INDEX (III) SUPPORT, A TRANSACTION ARCHIVE AND A ROBUST SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. THESE SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS WERE CONSTRUCTED USING BEST PRACTICES IN THE AREAS OF COMPUTING HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND OPEN INTERFACE STANDARDS.

 THE MCIC CONTINUES TO EMPLOY PROVEN STRATEGIES IN DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND DEPLOYMENT IMPROVEMENTS. TODAY, BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS NCHIP FUNDING, MISSISSIPPIS NCIC SYSTEM IS CENTERED AROUND THE MCHS REPOSITORY BASED ON OPEN STANDARDS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE MCIC HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO MAKE BROAD IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS SYSTEMS AND QUALITY OF DATA BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS NCHIP FUNDING, STATE FUNDING, AND OTHER FEDERAL GRANT RESOURCES. THESE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE:


	A DEVELOPED PROCESS FOR ENTRY AND VERIFICATION OF INTERSTATE IDENTIFICATION INDEX (III) ENTRIES WITH PARTICIPATING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. THIS IS A CONTINUOUS EFFORT BY THE MISSISSIPPI JUSTICE INFORMATION CENTER (MJIC) TO IMPROVE THE TIMELINESS AND QUALITY OF SUBMISSIONS AND ACTIVE RECORDS ON THE III FILE; 
	MISSISSIPPI PARTICIPATES IN NICS INSTANT BACKGROUND CHECKS WITH CRIMINAL DATA. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI PASSED LEGISLATION IN MARCH 2013 REQUIRING MDPS TO REPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH DISPOSITIONS THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY A CANDIDATE FROM RECEIVING A FIREARMS PERMIT TO NICS/FBI. FUNDING SOLICITATION WAS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED UNDER THE IMPROVING THE COMPLETENESS OF FIREARM BACKGROUND CHECKS THROUGH ENHANCED STATE DATA SHARING FY 2013 COMPETITIVE GRANT ANNOUNCEMENT. MDPS HAS IMPLEMENTED A WEB-BASED APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS COURT PERSONNEL TO ENTER THE DISQUALIFYING MENTAL HEALTH ADJUDICATION AT THE TIME JUDGMENT IS RENDERED. MDPS CONTINUES TO WORK WITH COURTS TO IMPROVE THE TIMELINESS OF SUBMITTING NICS EXCLUSION INFORMATION.
	MCIC CONTINUES TO WORK WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND COURTS TO IMPLEMENT SUBMISSION OF FINAL CASE DISPOSITIONS WITH ALL OF MISSISSIPPIS COURTS.
	MISSISSIPPI CONTINUES TO UPGRADE AND ENHANCE ITS INTEGRATED AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (IAFIS) AND IS FINALIZING EFFORTS TO COMPLETE A MAJOR UPGRADE OF THE IAFIS SOLUTION THAT WILL INCREASE THE DATABASE CAPACITY FOR FINGERPRINT AND TRANSACTION VOLUME ALONG WITH ACCURACY AND WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENTS THAT MEET THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY FEATURES AVAILABLE FOR THESE TYPE SYSTEMS;
	MCIC PERSONNEL, IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONTRACTORS, ACTIVELY REVIEW SYSTEMS DATA BY PROBING AND MINING FOR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS IN THE TYPE AND QUALITY OF DATA.
	THE MCIC CONTINUES TO COLLABORATE WITH THE STATES COURTS TO IMPROVE FINAL DISPOSITION SUBMISSIONS TO THE REPOSITORY.
	THE MCIC AND THE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE (AGO) JOINTLY OPERATE A STATEWIDE REGISTRY OF UNIFORM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPORTING. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI HAS A STATE REPOSITORY FOR PROTECTION ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM THAT INTERFACES TO THE FBIS NATIONAL PROTECTION ORDER FILE.


PROGRESS ON RECORD IMPROVEMENT GOALS:

 THE MDPS/MCIC CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF COURTS AS THE PROTECTION ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM AND THE ABILITY TO FORWARD PROTECTION ORDERS TO THE NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE IMPLEMENTED. 

 CURRENT STATUS IN SPECIFIC SUBJECT AREAS:


	DISPOSITION AVAILABLE TO III: MISSISSIPPI PARTICIPATES IN SENDING CASE DISPOSITIONS TO THE FBI VIA THE III DSP MESSAGE KEY. THE MISSISSIPPI CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM (MCHS) VENDOR HAS MODIFIED THE SYSTEMS PROCESS THAT WILL ALLOW MS TO TAKE TEMPORARY OWNERSHIP OF THE RECORD AND UPDATE THE DISPOSITION IN IAFIS. WITH THE MODIFIED PROCESS IN PLACE, A PREEXISTING BACKLOG OF REJECTED DSP MESSAGES THAT ACCUMULATED SINCE GOING LIVE HAS BEEN UPDATED AND SENT TO THE FBI. 


 UPON RECEIVING NOTIFICATION FROM THE FBI THAT THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPIS DISPOSITION REPORTING RATE WAS LOW, THE MS CRIMINAL INFORMATION CENTERS (MCIC) MANAGEMENT TEAM COMMUNICATED WITH THE COURT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE STATE REQUESTING DISPOSITION INFORMATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN SENT TO MCIC FOR PROCESSING. MCIC HAS STARTED RECEIVING MUCH OF THE MISSING DISPOSITION INFORMATION. MOST OF THE CORRESPONDENCE IS BEING PERFORMED THROUGH PAPER EXCHANGE, MAINLY MAILING AND FAXING WITH POSTING BY MCIC RECORDS TECHNICIANS. 

 THE MCIC MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COURT PERSONNEL TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE MEANS OF DISPOSITION SUBMISSION PROCESSING. 


	NICS INDEX AND MENTAL HEALTH RECORD AVAILABILITY: PREVIOUS MISSISSIPPI LAWS PROHIBITED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH RECORD CHECKS IN NICS; THEREFORE THE STATE HAD NO STATEWIDE DATABASE OF ADJUDICATED MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI PASSED LEGISLATION IN MARCH 2013 ALLOWING THE MDPS TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE MENTAL HEALTH DISPOSITIONS THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY A CANDIDATE FROM RECEIVING A FIREARMS OR FIREARM PERMITS TO NICS/FBI. FUNDING SOLICITATION WAS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED UNDER THE IMPROVING THE COMPLETENESS OF FIREARM BACKGROUND CHECKS THROUGH ENHANCED STATE DATA SHARING FY 2013 COMPETITIVE GRANT ANNOUNCEMENT. MDPS HAS IMPLEMENTED A WEB-BASED APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS COURT PERSONNEL TO ENTER THE DISQUALIFYING MENTAL HEALTH ADJUDICATION AT THE TIME JUDGMENT IS RENDERED. 
	PROTECTION ORDER FILES: THE MCIC HAS WORKED WITH THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HAS IMPLEMENTED A COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM PROVIDED BY 2008 SDVRIP GRANT FUNDING, FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN IN-STATE PROTECTION ORDER REGISTRY SYSTEM THAT FORWARDS PROTECTION ORDERS TO THE NATIONAL SYSTEM. 
	WARRANTS/WANTED PERSON RECORDS: THE MCIC DOES SUBMIT INFORMATION FOR INCLUSION IN THE FBIS NCIC WANTED PERSONS FILE. 


 WHILE THE MDPS/MCIC HAS BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE ITS ABILITY TO EMPLOY PROVEN STRATEGIES IN THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND DEPLOYMENT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN ITS CRIMINAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SINCE INCEPTION; THE AGENCY FINDS THE NEED FOR THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF INTEREST TO: 


	CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) TO PROVIDE AN UPGRADE TO THE CONFIGURATOR FROM 6.5  7.5 AS PART OF A REQUIRED PREREQUISITE FOR THE XML N3G UPGRADE FOR SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETYS (MDPS) STATE MESSAGE SWITCH. 
	CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) IMPLEMENT THE DATAMAXX SESSION MODIFICATIONS TO MODIFY THE SERVER TO PROCESS CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO THE DAC STATIONS.
	CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT DQ (DRIVER LICENSE QUERY)/KQ (DRIVER HISTORY QUERY) RESPONSE TO CONFIGURE THE TWO-MESSAGE KEY.


MANY IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE STATES CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM HAVE BEEN DUE, IN PART, TO A COMBINATION OF PREVIOUS NCHIP GRANTS, AS WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING. WITHOUT SUCH FUNDING, THE AGENCY CANNOT FINANCIALLY UNDERTAKE PROJECTS OF THIS MAGNITUDE. AT THE PRESENT TIME, NO LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE AGENCY TO CONTINUE THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. PREVIOUS NCHIP FUNDING OBTAINED BY MDPS HAS ALL BEEN OBLIGATED, THEREFORE, EXTERNAL RESOURCES SUCH AS THE FY2021 NCHIP FUNDING IS SOUGHT TO ASSIST THE MDPS IN FULFILLING ITS COMMITMENT TO ONGOING IMPROVEMENT OF MISSISSIPPIS CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM. THE GOAL OF THE MDPS IS TO ENHANCE THE STATES CRIMINAL HISTORY SYSTEM TO IMPROVE DATA QUALITY, DATA EXCHANGE PROCESSES AND DATA AVAILABILITY TO NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. 

SECTION B: PROJECT DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION: DESCRIPTION OF TASKS TO BE FUNDED UNDER NCHIP

 THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY (MDPS) REQUESTS BJS FY 2021 NATIONAL CRIMINAL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (NCHIP) FUNDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING NEEDED SUPPLEMENTAL PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT THAT WILL ENABLE THE AGENCY TO:


	CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) TO PROVIDE A APPLICATION SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETYS (MDPS) STATE MESSAGE SWITCH.


CONTRACT WITH CPI TO PROVIDE AN APPLICATION SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE CONFIGURATOR FROM 6.7 TO 7.5 AS PART OF THE MDPS STATE MESSAGE SWITCH. ($273,050.00): MDPS IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO CONTRACT WITH CPI TO PROVIDE AN APPLICATION SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE CONFIGURATOR FROM 6.5 TO 7.5 AS PART OF THE MDPS STATE MESSAGE SWITCH UPGRADE, WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE FOR UPGRADING THE MESSAGE SWITCH WITH XML N3G. CPI WILL PROVIDE NATIONAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE MODEL (NIEM) CONFIGURATIONS ALONG WITH MESSAGE KEY TRANSFORMATION OF ALL THE NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) KEYS AND APPLY THEM TO ALL INBOUND AND OUTBOUND NCIC MESSAGES.

 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS PERFORMED THROUGH MCIC ARE REQUIRED FOR OCCUPATIONS SUCH AS TEACHERS, BANKERS, CASINO WORKERS, PHYSICIANS, PHARMACISTS, THERAPIST, NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS PLUS A RANGE OF OTHER AUTHORIZED PROFESSIONS. MCIC ALSO ALLOWS BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED ON INDIVIDUALS APPLYING FOR GUN PERMITS OR PURCHASING WEAPONS TO PREVENT CANDIDATES WITH CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH ADJUDICATIONS FROM ATTAINING A FIREARM PERMIT. IN ALL THESE CASES IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT DISPOSITIONS BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE EVALUATING APPLICANT BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ENSURE CITIZENS ARE NOT DISALLOWED OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON MISSING INFORMATION. MCIC IS CURRENTLY WORKING CPI TO BECOME COMPLIANT WITH THE NLETS MANDATE TO SUNSET LEGACY, NON-STANDARD DOT DELIMITED TEXT FORMATS. HAVING CPI TO UPGRADE THE APPLICATION SYSTEM WOULD BE THE FINAL PIECE FOR THE XML PROJECT. THIS WOULD BRING THE STATE TO FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE NLETS MANDATE IS DEPENDENT ON THE IN-STATE REPOSITORIES OR ENDPOINTS AND IS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL WORK FROM CPI, THE STATE, AND/OR THIRD-PARTY.

CONTRACT WITH COMPUTER PROJECTS OF ILLINOIS, INC. (CPI) IMPLEMENT THE DATAMAXX SESSION MODIFICATIONS TO MODIFY THE SERVER TO PROCESS CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO THE DAC STATIONS. ($20,000).

MDPS IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT THE DATAMAXX SESSION MODIFICATIONS PROJECT FOR THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

THIS CHANGE WILL ADD LOGIC THAT WILL ALLOW DAC STATIONS TO BE ADDED OR REMOVED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR THE CUSTOMER TO SET THE SERVERS DOWN TO RECOGNIZE THOSE CHANGES.

CPI WILL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS AND/OR SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION: MODIFY THE DATAMAXX SERVER (DMXSRV) INTERFACE CODE TO PROCESS CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO DAC STATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED OR DELETED FROM AN ALREADY LOGGED ON SERVER (SRVR) CLASS STATION CONTROLLED BY THE DMXSRV INTERFACE I.E. AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THE LIST OF DAC STATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXISTING SRVR.

CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT DQ (DRIVER LICENSE QUERY)/KQ (DRIVER HISTORY QUERY) RESPONSE TO CONFIGURE THE TWO-MESSAGE KEY. ($16,950.00)

MDPS IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO CONTRACT WITH CPI TO IMPLEMENT THE DRIVER LICENSE QUERY AND THE DRIVER HISTORY QUERY WHICH WILL CONFIGURE DRIVERS LICENSE QUERY (DQX) AND DRIVER HISTORY QUERY (KQX) MKE ASCOPIES OF THE CURRENT DRIVERS LICENSE QUERY (DQ) AND DRIVER HISTORY QUERY (KQ) REMOVE ALL FILE ROUTES FROM DQX AND KQX EXCEPT FOR THE DMVWS FILE ROUTE MODIFY OPENFOX MESSAGE SWITCH PROCESSING FOR DRIVERS LICENSE RESPONSE (DR) AND DRIVER HISTORY RESPONSE (KR).

THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF COURTS (AOC) IS AWARE OF MDPS/MCICS EFFORTS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE AOCS LETTER OFFICIALLY DECLINING PARTICIPATION IS PROVIDED AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THIS GRANT APPLICATION.

SECTION C: CAPABILITIES AND COMPETENCIES - COORDINATION

 THE MISSISSIPPI OFFICE OF HOMELAND SECURITY (MOHS) IS A SUBDIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. THE MOHS HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION TO THE STATE'S LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES AS WELL AS TO OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, ESPECIALLY DURING CRISIS SITUATIONS. THE MCICS RESOURCES, AS WELL AS ARREST AND DISPOSITION INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO MOHS AND IN TURN TO LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES.

 THOUGH THE AFOREMENTIONED PROJECT SUBMITTED FOR FUNDING DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COURT SYSTEMS, MDPS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE MISSISSIPPI ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF COURTS (AOC) TO IDENTIFY ANY AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT AS WELL AS NEW, INNOVATIVE WAYS OF INFORMATION SHARING. IN ADDITION, AS THE STATE'S LEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, THE MDPS WILL BE WORKING WITH OTHER STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, COUNTY SHERIFF OFFICES, AND MUNICIPAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THESE STAKEHOLDERS' NEEDS WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT.

 ACTIVITIES DETAILED FOR THE 2021 NCHIP PROGRAM WILL BE COORDINATED WITH CURRENT AND PREVIOUS RECORDS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. THE GOAL OF THE MCIC IS TO PROVIDE A SINGLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR ALL LEVELS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS BOTH WITHIN THE STATE AND THROUGH NCIC/NLETS TO OTHER STATE AND NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES. AN ATTACHMENT TO THIS APPLICATION INCLUDES A MEMO SUBMITTED TO THE STATE'S TECHNOLOGY POINT-OF-CONTACT (POC) DETAILING OUR PLANS FOR THE 2021NCHIP PROJECT.

UNEXPENDED FUNDS: PREVIOUSLY AWARDED A GRANT MODIFICATION FOR NCHIP 2018 FUNDED PROJECTS ARE IN PROCESS. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WAS AWARDED $1,308,382.00 IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE OUTLINED PROJECTS. THE NCHIP 2018 PROJECTS ARE IN THE PROCUREMENT PHASES BUT THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES DELAYING THE PROJECTS.

BY TRANSFORMING NETWORK FUNCTIONS TO DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED SOFTWARE CONTAINERS, NEW TYPES OF APPLICATIONS CAN BE SUPPORTED ALONG WITH BETTER NETWORK MANAGEMENT. OPENNETVM IS AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PLATFORM THAT SEEKS TO LOWER THE BARRIER FOR RESEARCHERS WISHING TO EXPLORE CHALLENGES IN THIS AREA, AND FOR DEVELOPERS WISHING TO EVALUATE NEW TYPES OF NETWORK SERVICES. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE FOUNDATION THAT WILL ENABLE NEW INNOVATIONS IN THESE AREAS. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS WILL ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY TO ENCOURAGE ADOPTION THROUGH FREQUENT TUTORIALS AND DEMONSTRATIONS. COMMUNICATION NETWORKS HAVE INCREASINGLY BECOME `SOFTWARE BASED'. NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALIZATION (NFV) PROVIDES A HIGH-PERFORMANCE NETWORK DATA PLANE (E.G., MIDDLEBOXES LIKE FIREWALLS, PROXIES) AND IS CURRENTLY SEEING BOTH RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY INTEREST. NFV RESEARCH HAS BEEN STYMIED BY THE INADEQUATE SOFTWARE PLATFORMS THAT EITHER OFFER ONLY VERY LOW-LEVEL ACCESS TO PACKET DATA (MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE COMPLEX SERVICES), OR ARE BASED ON TRADITIONAL PACKET-PROCESSING APPROACHES THAT HAVE VERY POOR PERFORMANCE FOR CURRENT-DAY APPLICABILITY. THE RESEARCHERS WILL MAINTAIN OPENNETVM AS AN OPEN-SOURCE (BSD (BERKELEY SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION) LICENSE) SOFTWARE INFRASTRUCTURE, PROVIDING HIGH-LEVEL ABSTRACTIONS WITH AN UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK THAT PROVIDES WIRE-SPEED PERFORMANCE, PRIMITIVES FOR SCHEDULING, AND SCALABILITY, THAT OFFERS BOTH INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS A WAY TO QUICKLY AND CONVENIENTLY BUILD NETWORK FUNCTIONS. OPENNETVM RUNS NETWORK FUNCTIONS IN LIGHTWEIGHT CONTAINERS, EASILY COMBINED TO FORM COMPLEX SERVICE CHAINS. THE PROJECT SEEKS TO PROVIDE IMPROVED SUPPORT FOR REAL MIDDLEBOXES WITH OPENNETVM BY ADDING USER SPACE PROTOCOL STACKS ENABLING MORE COMPLEX NFS AND SERVICES, SUBSTANTIALLY EXPANDING THE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS SUPPORTED. THE PROJECT ALSO EXPANDS OPENNETVM TO SUPPORT MANY NFS THAT SHARE EACH CPU CORE, AND DISTRIBUTED DEPLOYMENTS WHERE NFS ARE SPREAD ACROSS A CLUSTER, THUS ENABLING RESEARCH INTO NFV RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NF PLACEMENT, AND COMPLEX SERVICE CHAINING. FINALLY, OPENNETVM WILL BE EXTENDED TO EXPOSE LOW-LEVEL PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT WILL ENABLE RESEARCH INTO AUTOMATED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS. TO FACILITATE ADOPTION THE RESEARCHERS WILL PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION, TUTORIALS AT MAJOR CONFERENCES, AND TEMPLATE IMAGES USING PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES SUCH AS NSF CLOUDLAB. THE RESULT WILL BE A COMPREHENSIVE, OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM THAT CAN BE USED BROADLY ACROSS THE NETWORKING AND OPERATING SYSTEMS COMMUNITIES.

THESE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS) THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO ATTACK THROUGH THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, THROUGH THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS POWER FLOW, WATER FLOW, CHEMISTRY, ETC., OR THROUGH BOTH. THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH COMPROMISED SYSTEMS INCLUDE FINANCIAL DISASTER, CIVIL DISORDER, EVEN THE LOSS OF LIFE. THE PROPOSED WORK SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCES THE SCIENCE OF PROTECTING CPS BY ENSURING THAT THE SYSTEMS DO WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO DESPITE AN ATTACKER TRYING TO MAKE THEM FAIL OR DO HARM. IN THIS CONVERGENT APPROACH, THE KEY IS TO TELL THE CPS HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BEHAVE AND BUILD IN DEFENSES THAT MAKE SURE EACH COMPONENT BEHAVES AND WORKS WELL WITH OTHERS. THE PROPOSED WORK HAS A CLEAR TRANSITION TO INDUSTRIAL PRACTICE. IT WILL ALSO ENHANCE EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY BY OPENING UP SECURING SOCIETY AS A FASCINATING DISCIPLINE FOR K-12 STUDENTS TO FOLLOW. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO PRODUCE, FROM UNTRUSTED COMPONENTS, A TRUSTED CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM (CPS) THAT IS RESILIENT TO SECURITY ATTACKS AND FAILURES. THE APPROACH WILL RELY ON INFORMATION FLOWS IN BOTH THE CYBER AND PHYSICAL SUBSYSTEMS, AND WILL BE VALIDATED EXPERIMENTALLY ON HIGH FIDELITY WATER TREATMENT AND ELECTRIC POWER CPS TESTBEDS. THE PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER CONCEPTS FROM DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING, CONTROL THEORY, MACHINE LEARNING, AND ESTIMATION THEORY TO SYNTHESIZE A COMPLETE MITIGATION OF THE SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL THREATS TO A CPS. THE PROPOSED METHOD'S KEY DIFFERENCE FROM CURRENT METHODS IS THAT SECURITY HOLES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND PLUGGED AUTOMATICALLY AT SYSTEM DESIGN TIME, THEN ENFORCED DURING RUNTIME WITHOUT RELYING SOLELY ON SECURE BOUNDARIES OR FIREWALLS. THE SYSTEM WILL FEATURE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND ISOLATE A MALFUNCTIONING DEVICE OR CYBER-PHYSICAL INTRUSION IN REAL-TIME BY VALIDATING ITS OPERATION AGAINST FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC/ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND LEARNED BEHAVIOR. A COMBINED MATHEMATICAL/DATA SCIENCE APPROACH WILL BE USED TO GENERATE GOVERNING INVARIANTS THAT ARE ENFORCED AT SYSTEM RUNTIME. INVARIANTS ARE A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH GROUNDED IN THE SYSTEM'S PHYSICS COUPLED WITH MACHINE LEARNING AND REAL-TIME SCHEDULING APPROACHES EMBEDDED IN THE CPS. ROBUST STATE ESTIMATION WILL ACCOUNT FOR ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT AND AUTOMATED SECURITY DOMAIN CONSTRUCTION AND OPTIMIZATION TO REDUCE THE COST OF EVALUATION WITHOUT SACRIFICING COVERAGE. THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THIS RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED NATIONAL SECURITY ACROSS VARIOUS CPS INFRASTRUCTURES WHICH, IN TURN, WILL IMPROVE ECONOMIC AND POPULATION HEALTH AND SECURITY. THE WORK CAN BE TAKEN TO INDUSTRY FOR DEPLOYMENT IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES. THE PROJECT WILL STIMULATE INTEREST IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WATER-THEMED TABLETOP EXERCISE FOR K-12 AND HELPING CURRENT COLLEGE STUDENTS DEVELOP AN INTEREST IN OUTREACH THROUGH THE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING ASPECTS OF DEVELOPING THE TABLETOP EXERCISE.

TODAY, HUGE VOLUMES OF MANY TYPES OF SCIENTIFIC DATA ARE ROUTINELY UPLOADED TO THE CLOUD. A LARGE FRACTION OF THIS DATA IS PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY SENSITIVE. UNFORTUNATELY, DESPITE NUMEROUS ADVANCES IN NETWORK AND ENTERPRISE SECURITY, MODERN CLOUDS REMAIN INHERENTLY INSECURE. RECENT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT WELL-FUNDED, TARGETED ATTACKS MANAGE TO BREACH NETWORK PERIMETERS OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUDS. HORIZON IS A NOVEL CLOUD ARCHITECTURE AIMED AT PROVIDING DATA AND COMPUTATION SECURITY WITHIN A SCIENTIFIC CLOUD. HORIZON BUILDS UPON THREE PREMISES: (1) STRONG ISOLATION ON END-HOSTS, (2) FINE-GRAINED ISOLATION IN THE CLOUD NETWORK, AND (3) CLOUD-WIDE INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL. TO PROTECT THE END-HOSTS, HORIZON DEVELOPS A NEW LAYERED HYPERVISOR, AND DISAGGREGATED VIRTUALIZATION STACK WITH KEY FEATURES OF: LANGUAGE SAFETY, SOFTWARE FAULT ISOLATION, AND INTEGRATED SOFTWARE VERIFICATION. TO PROVIDE SECURE CLOUD NETWORK ENVIRONMENT, HORIZON RELIES ON A NEW NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTS A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK FIREWALL, WHERE ALL NETWORK COMMUNICATION AND EXCHANGE OF RIGHTS ARE MEDIATED AND CONTROLLED BY THE RULES OF THE OBJECT CAPABILITY SYSTEM. TO PROTECT THE CLOUD DATA, HORIZON DEVELOPS A SET OF ABSTRACTIONS AND MECHANISMS TO ENFORCE CLOUD-WIDE INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL. IN HORIZON ALL DATA IS LABELED. THE HYPERVISOR MEDIATES ALL COMMUNICATION OF EACH VIRTUAL MACHINE AND ENFORCES PROPAGATION OF LABELS AND SECURITY CHECKS FOR EACH CLOUD COMPUTATION. HORIZON AIMS TO PROVIDE A PRACTICAL FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING SECURE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE SUITABLE FOR LARGE-SCALE RESEARCH WORKFLOWS THAT REQUIRE BOTH SPEED AND SECURITY.

THIS CAN HAVE SERIOUS SECURITY IMPLICATIONS FOR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS (VPNS) AND DOMAIN VALIDATION ((DV), THAT PROVES AN ORGANIZATION OWNS AN INTERNET DOMAIN SUCH AS WWW.EXAMPLE.COM BEFORE ISSUING A CERTIFICATE THAT THE ORGANIZATION CAN PRESENT TO WEB BROWSERS AS AUTHENTICATION). A SIDE CHANNEL IS A MECHANISM WHERE INFORMATION FLOWS WHERE IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO FLOW ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN OF A SYSTEM. AN ANALOGY MIGHT BE A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT COUNTING THE NUMBER OF PIZZA DELIVERIES TO THE PENTAGON AND INFERRING LAST-MINUTE PLANNING FOR A BIG EVENT WHEN THE NUMBER OF PIZZAS INCREASES SHARPLY. IN OTHER CONTEXTS, SIDE CHANNELS HAVE LED TO FUNDAMENTAL BREAKDOWNS IN THE BASIC SECURITY MECHANISMS THAT SEPARATE PROCESSES IN AN OPERATING SYSTEM (SEE MELTDOWN AND SPECTRE, WHICH ARE VULNERABILITIES IN THE WAY COMPUTERS ENFORCE THE MOST BASIC SEPARATION OF SECURITY CONTEXTS), AND HAVE BEEN USED TO CRACK EVEN THEN STRONGEST CRYPTOGRAPHY. THE TCP AND IP PROTOCOLS LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE INTERNET, BUT ARE KNOWN TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIDE CHANNELS IF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET. REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCS), (THE DOCUMENTS THAT DEVELOP AND DEFINE INTERNET STANDARDS) DESCRIBE HOW, FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN NUMBERS MUST BE CHOSEN IN AN UNPREDICTABLE MANNER, OR LIMITING THE RATE AT WHICH PACKETS ARE SENT MUST BE APPLIED IN A SPECIFIC WAY, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF TCP/IP SIDE CHANNELS. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RFCS UNDERMINES THE MOST BASIC ASSUMPTION OF INTERNET SECURITY: THAT IN ORDER FOR AN ATTACKER TO INFER THE EXISTENCE OF, INTERFERE WITH, OR INJECT THEIR OWN DATA INTO A COMMUNICATION THE ATTACKER MUST CONTROL A PART OF THE NETWORK IN BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES THAT ARE COMMUNICATING. VIOLATING THIS BASIC ASSUMPTION CAN BE DEVASTATING FOR INTERNET USERS THAT ARE ACTING IN THE U.S.'S INTEREST, SUCH AS JOURNALISTS, ACTIVISTS, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) OVERSEAS THAT USE TUNNELING OF SOME KIND TO BYPASS INTERNET CONTROLS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. A MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGE THAT THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS IS TO EXPLORE THE ASTRONOMICALLY LARGE NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES FOR HOW SEQUENCES OF PROBES SENT BY RESEARCHERS MIGHT RESULT IN PREDICTABLE PATTERNS IN THE RESPONSES GIVEN BY DIFFERENT INTERNET HOSTS. PREDICTABLE PATTERNS INDICATE A VULNERABILITY BECAUSE THE SECURITY MODEL ASSUMES AN ATTACKER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GUESS THE NUMBERS THAT PROTOCOLS USE FOR SEQUENCING AND OTHER PURPOSES. THIS PROJECT COMBINES EXPERTISE IN NETWORK SECURITY AND DATA MINING TO SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR PATTERNS WHERE THERE SHOULD BE NONE. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CAREFULLY DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS TO MEASURE HOW INTERNET HOSTS RESPOND TO DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF PROBES, TEMPORAL DATA MINING TO UNCOVER PATTERNS, AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEASURING THE ENTIRE INTERNET LONGITUDINALLY, THE PROJECT WILL REVEAL HOW CUSTOM NETWORK STACKS HAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF INTERNET SERVERS DO NOT PROTECT AGAINST SIDE CHANNEL ATTACKS. THESE CUSTOM TCP/IP IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE COMMONLY DEVELOPED FOR THE CLOUD, MIDDLEBOXES SUCH AS LOAD BALANCERS AND FIREWALLS, AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS THIS SITUATION THROUGH THE ETHICAL DISCLOSURE PROCESS, ENGAGING INTERNET STANDARDS BODIES, AND EDUCATING RESEARCHERS AND USERS ABOUT THESE THREATS.

THIS CAN HAVE SERIOUS SECURITY IMPLICATIONS FOR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS (VPNS) AND DOMAIN VALIDATION ((DV), THAT PROVES AN ORGANIZATION OWNS AN INTERNET DOMAIN SUCH AS WWW.EXAMPLE.COM BEFORE ISSUING A CERTIFICATE THAT THE ORGANIZATION CAN PRESENT TO WEB BROWSERS AS AUTHENTICATION). A SIDE CHANNEL IS A MECHANISM WHERE INFORMATION FLOWS WHERE IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO FLOW ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN OF A SYSTEM. AN ANALOGY MIGHT BE A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT COUNTING THE NUMBER OF PIZZA DELIVERIES TO THE PENTAGON AND INFERRING LAST-MINUTE PLANNING FOR A BIG EVENT WHEN THE NUMBER OF PIZZAS INCREASES SHARPLY. IN OTHER CONTEXTS, SIDE CHANNELS HAVE LED TO FUNDAMENTAL BREAKDOWNS IN THE BASIC SECURITY MECHANISMS THAT SEPARATE PROCESSES IN AN OPERATING SYSTEM (SEE MELTDOWN AND SPECTRE, WHICH ARE VULNERABILITIES IN THE WAY COMPUTERS ENFORCE THE MOST BASIC SEPARATION OF SECURITY CONTEXTS), AND HAVE BEEN USED TO CRACK EVEN THEN STRONGEST CRYPTOGRAPHY. THE TCP AND IP PROTOCOLS LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE INTERNET, BUT ARE KNOWN TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIDE CHANNELS IF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET. REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCS), (THE DOCUMENTS THAT DEVELOP AND DEFINE INTERNET STANDARDS) DESCRIBE HOW, FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN NUMBERS MUST BE CHOSEN IN AN UNPREDICTABLE MANNER, OR LIMITING THE RATE AT WHICH PACKETS ARE SENT MUST BE APPLIED IN A SPECIFIC WAY, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF TCP/IP SIDE CHANNELS. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RFCS UNDERMINES THE MOST BASIC ASSUMPTION OF INTERNET SECURITY: THAT IN ORDER FOR AN ATTACKER TO INFER THE EXISTENCE OF, INTERFERE WITH, OR INJECT THEIR OWN DATA INTO A COMMUNICATION THE ATTACKER MUST CONTROL A PART OF THE NETWORK IN BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES THAT ARE COMMUNICATING. VIOLATING THIS BASIC ASSUMPTION CAN BE DEVASTATING FOR INTERNET USERS THAT ARE ACTING IN THE U.S.'S INTEREST, SUCH AS JOURNALISTS, ACTIVISTS, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) OVERSEAS THAT USE TUNNELING OF SOME KIND TO BYPASS INTERNET CONTROLS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. A MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGE THAT THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS IS TO EXPLORE THE ASTRONOMICALLY LARGE NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES FOR HOW SEQUENCES OF PROBES SENT BY RESEARCHERS MIGHT RESULT IN PREDICTABLE PATTERNS IN THE RESPONSES GIVEN BY DIFFERENT INTERNET HOSTS. PREDICTABLE PATTERNS INDICATE A VULNERABILITY BECAUSE THE SECURITY MODEL ASSUMES AN ATTACKER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GUESS THE NUMBERS THAT PROTOCOLS USE FOR SEQUENCING AND OTHER PURPOSES. THIS PROJECT COMBINES EXPERTISE IN NETWORK SECURITY AND DATA MINING TO SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR PATTERNS WHERE THERE SHOULD BE NONE. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CAREFULLY DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS TO MEASURE HOW INTERNET HOSTS RESPOND TO DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF PROBES, TEMPORAL DATA MINING TO UNCOVER PATTERNS, AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEASURING THE ENTIRE INTERNET LONGITUDINALLY, THE PROJECT WILL REVEAL HOW CUSTOM NETWORK STACKS HAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF INTERNET SERVERS DO NOT PROTECT AGAINST SIDE CHANNEL ATTACKS. THESE CUSTOM TCP/IP IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE COMMONLY DEVELOPED FOR THE CLOUD, MIDDLEBOXES SUCH AS LOAD BALANCERS AND FIREWALLS, AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS THIS SITUATION THROUGH THE ETHICAL DISCLOSURE PROCESS, ENGAGING INTERNET STANDARDS BODIES, AND EDUCATING RESEARCHERS AND USERS ABOUT THESE THREATS. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND OUTREACH WILL LEVERAGE THE UNIQUE POPULATION OF THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. AND THE EXPERTISE OF THE PIS TO SUPPORT DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FIELD AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

NNA PROJECTS ADDRESS CONVERGENCE SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGES IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING ARCTIC. THE ARCTIC RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO INFORM THE ECONOMY, SECURITY AND RESILIENCE OF THE NATION, THE LARGER REGION AND THE GLOBE. NNA EMPOWERS NEW RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS FROM LOCAL TO INTERNATIONAL SCALES, DIVERSIFIES THE NEXT GENERATION OF ARCTIC RESEARCHERS, ENHANCES EFFORTS IN FORMAL AND INFORMAL EDUCATION, AND INTEGRATES THE CO-PRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE WHERE APPROPRIATE. THIS AWARD FULFILLS PART OF THAT AIM BY SUPPORTING PLANNING ACTIVITIES WITH CLEAR POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP NOVEL, LEADING EDGE RESEARCH IDEAS AND APPROACHES TO ADDRESS NNA GOALS. IT INTEGRATES ASPECTS OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, BUILT ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS, AND ADDRESSES IMPORTANT SOCIETAL CHALLENGES, BUILDS SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENGAGES WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES. DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN THE ARCTIC, WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO GROW IN INCREASED FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE, ARE DRIVEN BY MULTIFACETED FACTORS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, EXPANDED WILDLAND-HUMAN INTERFACE, AND LACK OF MODELS TO INTEGRATE NATURAL, ENGINEERING, AND SOCIAL SCIENCES TO HELP COORDINATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY DECISIONS. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ENERGY NETWORK AND WILDFIRES IS HIGHLY INTERRELATED SINCE WILDFIRES ARE COMPOUNDED DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY BY INACCURATE AND IMPRECISE MANAGEMENT OF THE ENERGY NETWORK. THE SITUATION BECOMES FURTHER COMPLICATED IN ARCTIC REGIONS WITH COMPLEX TERRAIN, CONSTANT EXPOSURE TO NATURE?S FORCES, AND VULNERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE, LEADING TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LOSSES. THOUGH A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS, THIS NNA PROJECT ENABLES CREATIVE BRAINSTORMING, BUILDS SYNERGISTIC MODELS, AND GUIDES MULTIDISCIPLINARY DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL GENERATE KNOWLEDGE ON BETTER UNDERSTANDING, NAVIGATING, PLANNING, AND ADAPTING TO EVOLVING ALASKA WILDFIRE REGIMES. THROUGH THE LENS OF ENERGY RESILIENCE, THE PROJECT SUPPORTS BUILDING STRONGER TIES AND FACILITATES A TWO-WAY DIALOGUE AMONG RESEARCHERS, LOCAL COMMUNITIES, AND STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS, OPERATIONAL ENDURANCE, AND ENHANCED RESILIENCE TO WILDFIRES. THIS NNA PLANNING GRANT EXPANDS SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS BEFORE, DURING, AND FOLLOWING WILDFIRES. IT GENERATES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE INTERACTION OF WILDFIRES WITH ENERGY SYSTEMS AND BUILDS ON THOSE INSIGHTS TO DEVELOP RESEARCH DIRECTIONS AND ROADMAPS TO DEPLOY ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES FOR STRUCTURAL AND OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE AGAINST WILDFIRES, WHILE CONSIDERING LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS. THE PROJECT SHAPES RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ON THE VARIED WILDFIRE TRIGGERS IN ALASKA, ENHANCES UNDERSTANDING OF INTERACTIONS OF ALASKAN ENERGY NETWORKS AND WILDFIRES, AND GUIDES STRATEGIC PLANS FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. FURTHER, THE PROJECT ENGAGES LOCAL ALASKAN COMMUNITIES WITH AN INTEGRAL AND ACTIVE ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING PLANS AGAINST THE UNDESIRABLE SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES OF WILDFIRES. THE WORKSHOPS IN THIS PROJECT ENGENDER A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM THAT USES THE KNOWLEDGE AND RELATIONS GAINED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS TO SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, STRENGTHEN THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ARCTIC AND NON-ARCTIC COMMUNITIES, AND PROVIDE ARCTIC RESIDENTS WITH EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE ON ARCTIC WILDFIRE RESILIENCE.

ICT COMPANIES ARE AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES TO ADVANCE ONLINE SAFETY, SECURITY, AND PRIVACY. THE SHORTAGE OF CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS CREATES RISKS FOR BOTH NATIONAL AND HOMELAND SECURITY. THESE RISKS ARE EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF DIVERSITY AMONG CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS. CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF A MORE DIVERSE GROUP OF STUDENTS AND CAN BE EASILY IMPLEMENTED BY EDUCATORS ARE NEEDED. THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO CYBERSECURITY STARTING IN THE MIDDLE-SCHOOL YEARS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO SOLIDIFY THEIR ACADEMIC AND OTHER IDENTITIES. BY ENHANCING THE KNOWLEDGE OF CYBERSECURITY AND POSITIVE MOTIVATION, SUCH PROGRAMS COULD LEAD TO POTENTIAL FUTURE INTEREST IN CYBERSECURITY CAREERS, THUS CREATING A PIPELINE FOR A ROBUST AND DIVERSE CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE. THIS PROJECT WILL FORMULATE, DESIGN, AND PROTOTYPE INNOVATIVE MIXED-REALITY (MR) LEARNING CONTENT TO MAKE CYBERSECURITY CONCEPTS CONCRETE AND ENGAGING FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE WORK WILL BE GUIDED BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF SCHOLARS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE AND INVOLVES PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE DELAWARE CHAPTER OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION, LOCAL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS. THE PROJECT IS INTENDED TO DIRECTLY IMPACT 10 MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS AND APPROXIMATELY 350 STUDENTS INCLUDING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THROUGH THE DESIGN, PILOT, AND IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. THE PROJECT IS GUIDED BY THREE GOALS: (1) ITERATIVELY DESIGN A SET OF CONCRETE AND INTERACTIVE MR ACTIVITIES ADDRESSING KEY CYBERSECURITY CONCEPTS (E.G., STEGANOGRAPHY, PHISHING, AND FIREWALLS) WITH TEACHER AND STUDENT INPUT THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS; (2) INCREASE STUDENT KNOWLEDGE OF KEY CYBERSECURITY CONCEPTS, UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CYBERSECURITY, AND INTEREST IN CYBERSECURITY CAREERS; AND (3) PRODUCE A SET OF DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR MR ACTIVITIES IN COMPUTING. MR ACTIVITIES WILL BE ITERATIVELY REFINED BASED ON OBSERVATIONS, TEACHER INTERVIEWS, AND STUDENT SURVEY FEEDBACK. SHORT PRE-PILOTS WILL TEST THE USABILITY OF THE MATERIALS AND PROVIDE TEACHERS A CLASSROOM CONTEXT TO EVALUATE SUCCESS. A FINAL PILOT WILL BE CONDUCTED IN MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOMS UTILIZING A PRE/POSTTEST DESIGN WITH ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENT CYBERSECURITY LEARNING AND MOTIVATION. BASED ON THE WIDE ATTENTION ON CYBERSECURITY IN THE WORKFORCE, THIS WORK WILL HELP CREATE NEW MODELS FOR K-12 CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION WHILE EXPOSING STUDENTS TO NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. THE RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS, ASSESSMENT TOOLS, AND OUTCOMES OF THIS WORK WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH WORKSHOPS, PUBLICATIONS, PRESENTATIONS, AND A WEB PORTAL. THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCES FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS (ITEST) PROGRAM, WHICH SUPPORTS PROJECTS THAT BUILD UNDERSTANDINGS OF PRACTICES, PROGRAM ELEMENTS, CONTEXTS AND PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASING STUDENTS' KNOWLEDGE AND INTEREST IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) AND INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) CAREERS.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, MANY INSTRUCTORS WERE FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF HOW TO ADMINISTER EXAMS, QUIZZES EFFECTIVELY, AND OTHER IN-CLASS ASSIGNMENTS IN AN ONLINE SETTING IN WHICH LIVE, IN-PERSON PROCTORING WAS NOT AVAILABLE. ONLINE PROCTORING QUICKLY BECAME AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION TO MONITOR STUDENTS REMOTELY WHILE COMPLETING AN ASSIGNMENT. IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCREASING SHIFT TOWARDS LEARNING (AND TESTING) FROM HOME, THIS PROJECT WILL EXAMINE THE SECURITY AND PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS OF REMOTE PROCTORING SERVICES AS THEY PERTAIN TO SCHOOL POLICIES AND EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES. THIS MULTI-PRONGED RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL EXAMINE HOW THESE SERVICES IMPACT STUDENTS, EDUCATORS, AND INSTITUTIONS' SECURITY AND PRIVACY. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM IS INSPIRED BY THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF REMOTE PROCTORING SERVICES IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. HOWEVER, THE FINDINGS WILL BE MORE BROADLY APPLICABLE AS INSTITUTIONS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO OFFER VIRTUAL CLASSES AND ONLINE TECHNOLOGY SERVICES TO SUPPORT THOSE CLASSES. THE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND WILL ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE IN PEDAGOGY AS WELL AS ADDRESS VULNERABILITIES THAT STEM FROM HUMAN BEHAVIORS AND CHOICES IN SECURITY AND PRIVACY. ONLINE PROCTORING TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES EXTENSIVE MONITORING CAPABILITIES TO WORK PROPERLY; THESE INCLUDE SYSTEMS FOR OBSERVING BEHAVIOR (E.G., SCREEN CAPTURE AND VIDEO/AUDIO RECORDING) AND RESTRICTING BEHAVIOR (E.G., LOCK-DOWN BROWSING AND THE INSTALLATION OF NETWORK FIREWALL RULES). IN COMBINATION, THESE MONITORING AND RESTRICTING FUNCTIONALITIES IMPOSE PRIVACY AND SECURITY RISKS ON THE STUDENTS WHO ARE COMPLETING ASSIGNMENTS IN THIS SETTING.

THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL INCREASE UVI?S ABILITY TO SUPPORT ONGOING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND TEACHING AND ATTRACT NEW RESEARCHERS. NETWORK SWITCHING UPGRADES FROM 10/100BASE TRANSMISSION SPEEDS TO HIGH PERFORMING MULTIGIGABIT NETWORK SWITCHES ALLOW FOR INCREASED NETWORK CAPACITY AND REDUNDANCY REQUIRED TO ENABLE THE MOVEMENT OF SCIENTIFIC DATA TO CONDUCT VARIOUS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, PERMIT ADVANCED COMPUTING, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PUBLIC CLOUD COMPUTING AND STORAGE RESOURCES, AND ALSO SUPPORT THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT). THESE NETWORK IMPROVEMENTS WILL BUILD UPON PAST NSF CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS, SUPPORT UVI-BASED MARINE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH THAT INFORMS FEDERAL AND TERRITORIAL NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGERS FOCUSED ON MARINE ECOSYSTEMS HEALTH, INCREASE DATA SHARING BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND COLLABORATORS, AND HELP TO FACILITATE TIME-SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND REAL-TIME MODEL VALIDATION. UVI'S SCIENCE DMZ WILL OFFER A NETWORK ENVIRONMENT TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE SCIENCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING LARGE DATA TRANSFERS, REMOTE EXPERIMENT CONTROL, DATA VISUALIZATION, AND ADDRESSES NETWORK PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR WHEN LARGE RESEARCH DATA SETS TRAVERSE THROUGH FIREWALLS. IT ALSO WILL ENABLE FASTER PROCESSING OF DATA FOR UVI?S COLLABORATING PARTNER, THE NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY, A RADIO TELESCOPE FACILITY USED BY THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.

UVI'S SCIENCE DMZ WILL OFFER A NETWORK ENVIRONMENT TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE SCIENCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING LARGE DATA TRANSFERS, REMOTE EXPERIMENT CONTROL, DATA VISUALIZATION, AND ADDRESSES NETWORK PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR WHEN LARGE RESEARCH DATA SETS TRAVERSE THROUGH FIREWALLS. IT ALSO WILL ENABLE FASTER PROCESSING OF DATA FOR UVI?S COLLABORATING PARTNER, THE NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY, A RADIO TELESCOPE FACILITY USED BY THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY, COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM GROUPS TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM WILL BE PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR HANDS-ON TRAINING AND WORK EXPERIENCE. THIS PROJECT HAS POTENTIAL TO FACILITATE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, HELP BUILD HIGH-DEMAND TECHNICAL CAPACITY WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY AND ACROSS THE TERRITORY, AND MAKE A SOUND AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT IN CAMPUS-WIDE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION AT UVI. THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED THROUGH THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS OF THE OFFICE OF ADVANCED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE (OAC) AND THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR).

ALASKA IS ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRES DUE TO ITS ISOLATED ELECTRICITY GRID, FIRE-PRONE BOREAL FORESTS, AND EXTREME FIRE BEHAVIOR, AS WELL AS THE CRITICAL DEPENDENCE OF ITS RURAL COMMUNITIES ON ELECTRICITY FOR HEALTH AND YEAR-ROUND FOOD SUPPLY. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EMPOWER ARCTIC COMMUNITIES, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, AND HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS TO COLLABORATIVELY SHARE RESOURCES AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION FOR IMPROVED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND RESILIENCE AGAINST WILDFIRES. THE FIREWALL RESEARCH PROJECT WILL ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE ON (1) HOW ELEMENTS OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER BEFORE, DURING, AND FOLLOWING WILDFIRES, AND (2) HOW TO ENABLE A COLLABORATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR DECISION-MAKING AND COMMUNICATION AMONG MULTI-SECTORAL STAKEHOLDERS TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS FACED BY COMMUNITIES AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES. THE FIREWALL PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A RISK-INFORMED DECISION-MAKING PLATFORM THAT INTEGRATES (1) FORMATION, SHORT-TERM PREDICTION, AND SPATIOTEMPORAL PROPAGATION ANALYSIS OF WILDFIRES ON ALASKAN LANDS, (2) ALASKA?S ELECTRICITY NETWORK PLANNING, PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE, AND MITIGATION FACING WILDFIRES, AND (3) COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SOCIAL VULNERABILITY METRICS. THE PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM BY ENGAGING IN FOCUS GROUPS, LISTENING SESSIONS, AND SURVEYS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THE DECISION-MAKING PLATFORM WILL BE EVALUATED IN A RANGE OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM USE CASES FOR THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES, FORESTRY MANAGERS, AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS UNDER DIFFERENT FIRE REGIMES, AND WILL BE TESTED IN A NUMBER OF WILDFIRE-PRONE GEOGRAPHICAL ZONES IN ALASKA. THE PROJECT OUTCOMES WILL BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES WITH COMMUNITY-IN-THE-LOOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE, AND PROVIDE ARCTIC RESIDENTS WITH NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. THE EDUCATION ACTIVITIES INCLUDE OUTREACH TO K-12 TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, AND TRAINING THE MULTI-SECTORAL STAKEHOLDERS USING THE FIREWALL PLATFORM PRODUCTS TO FACILITATE A SMOOTH TRANSITION FOR DEPLOYMENT IN PRACTICE. THE PROJECT WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO FORM HOLISTIC INTEGRATED ROADMAPS THAT CAN ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY AND RESILIENCE OF THE MISSION-CRITICAL LIFELINE INFRASTRUCTURE IN ALASKA AND BEYOND WHEN FACING FUTURE WILDFIRE DISASTERS.

OUR MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND TO INCREASE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER SERVICES. WE PROVIDE A FULL RANGE OF MEDICAL, PREVENTIVE HEALTH, AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES.  APICHA CHC IS CONTINUALLY LOOKING TO IMPROVE ITS QUALITY OF CARE AND THE EFFICIENCY OF ITS OPERATIONS. WE SERVE A PATIENT POPULATION WITH UNIQUE, OFTENTIMES COMPLEX, NEEDS AND WE OPERATE WITHIN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. AS SUCH, WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SUPPORTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN HANDLE THE DEMANDS OF SERVING OUR CLIENT BASE. TO THIS END, APICHA CHC’S PROPOSED IT INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION PROJECT WILL UPGRADE AND ADD REDUNDANCY TO THE AGENCY’S TECHNOLOGY-RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AT ITS MANHATTAN CLINIC (400 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10013). WITH NETWORK REDUNDANCY, YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PATHS FOR INFORMATION TRAFFIC AND MORE BACK-UP OPTIONS, SO THAT DATA CAN KEEP FLOWING WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE STAFF WITH BETTER RELIABILITY AND PERFORMANCE. THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: ENSURING CONTINUOUS POWER FOR EQUIPMENT BY PROVIDING BACK-UP BATTERIES FOR SERVER ROOM EQUIPMENT; REMOVING EQUIPMENT THAT IS BEING UPGRADED, AND REWIRING CURRENT EQUIPMENT; ACHIEVING REDUNDANCY BY ESTABLISHING A SECOND IT CLOSET TO HOUSE A NEW SERVER; ACQUIRING UPGRADED AND REDUNDANT DEVICES (FIREWALLS/SWITCHES) THAT ARE KEY TO APICHA CHC'S NETWORK; MONITORING THE SERVER ROOM ENVIRONMENT TO ENSURE THE NETWORK EQUIPMENT IS SAFE AND CAN REMAIN OPERATIONAL; INSTALLING ADDITIONAL STORAGE AND MEMORY TO SERVERS; REPLACING CURRENT WIRELESS DEVICES WITH NEWER AND UPGRADED DE VICES; WIRING RUNS TO ALLOW FOR MORE PHYSICAL REDUNDANCY; AND UPGRADING WORKSTATIONS TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUNDANCY. THE PROJECT REQUIRES MINOR INTERIOR ALTERATION TO ALLOW FOR THE RUNNING OF LOW VOLTAGE (NETWORK) CABLES FROM THE 3RD FLOOR TO THE BASEMENT WHERE THE NEW BACKUP SERVER WILL BE LOCATED. THESE ACTIVITIES ALIGN WITH THE COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING/CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING (CPF/CDS) FUNDING THAT WAS REQUESTED BY SENATOR GILLIBRAND IN SUPPORT OF APICHA CHC’S IT INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION PROJECT, AND THAT WAS APPROVED UNDER THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT 2024. COMPLETION OF THESE ACTIVITIES WILL RESULT IN AN IT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS GREATER RESILIENCY AND RELIABILITY FROM A PHYSICAL-PLANT PERSPECTIVE. WITH THIS IMPROVED PERFORMANCE, APICHA CHC STAFF CAN BETTER SERVE ITS PATIENT POPULATION WITH LIFE-SAVING PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER HEALTH AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES.

THE HEALTH CENTER’S PART C PATIENT POPULATION EXPERIENCES MYRIAD ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES TO ACCESSING HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TELEMEDICINE HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PROVIDING INCREASED ACCESSIBILITY TO OUR HEALTH CENTER SERVICES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE CHALLENGING FOR OUR PATIENTS WITH HIV. THE HEALTH CENTER SERVES A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY POPULATION AS WELL AS POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING POVERTY, WHO TEND TO EXPERIENCE GREATER CHALLENGES RESULTING FROM SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH), AND THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF TELEMEDICINE AS AN OPTION FOR THESE PATIENTS HAS RESULTED IN IMPROVED NO-SHOW RATES, AS WELL AS POSITIVE PATIENT FEEDBACK AS PATIENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED IMPROVED OPTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHEDULING T HEIR VISITS. TELEMEDICINE HAS BEEN A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF IMPROVED ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV, WHICH HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS ON HEALTH EQUITY. THAT INCREASED ACCESS AND USAGE, HOWEVER, HAS ALSO RESULTED IN THE NEED FOR A LARGER CAPACITY AND MORE ROBUST INTERNET SECURITY APPARATUS. IN ADDITION, SUN RIVER HEALTH’S CURRENT FIREWALL SYSTEM IS AT ITS “END OF LIFE,” MEANING THE VENDOR WILL SOON NO LONGER PROVIDE ONGOING SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AND WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT SOFTWARE UPGRADES TO SUN RIVER HEALTH’S CURRENT HARDWARE.  - PROPOSED SERVICES:  SUN RIVER HEALTH IS REQUESTING RYAN WHITE PART C CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING TO PURCHASE UPGRADED FIREWALL SYSTEM CPU/HARDWARE UNITS AS WELL AS THE INITIAL LICENSING FEES AND VENDOR SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES FOR THE DURATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. THESE FIREWALL UNITS WILL ALLOW FOR HIGHER AVAILABILITY AND REDUNDANCY OF TELEMEDICINE SERVICES. BY UPGRADING OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS, THE HEALTH CENTER WILL BE ABLE TO INTERCEDE TO STOP MALICIOUS ACTORS ATTEMPTING TO COMPROMISE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCESS PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION, INTERRUPT OPERATIONS, AND CREATE RANSOMWARE EVENTS.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF MY PROPOSAL IS TO SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES AND DEVELOP THE FIRST MICROBIAL HOST FOR PROGRAMMABLE DRUG DELIVERY THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDES TIGHT BIOCONTAINMENT, PREVENTS TRANSGENE RELEASE - HORIZONTAL GENE TRANSFER - INTO WILD ORGANISMS, AND OFFERS INCREASED STABILITY FOR LONG-TERM DRUG PRODUCTION.

FINALLY, IN AIM 3, THE PI WILL COMBINE THESE DEVELOPMENTS INTO A MICROBIAL LIVING THERAPEUTIC HOST AND DEMONSTRATE IN A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT EXPERIMENT THAT THIS HOST ENABLES STABLE, LONG-TERM THERAPEUTIC ENZYME PRODUCTION INSIDE THE GI TRACT.  IN SUMMARY, THIS WORK WILL CREATE A TECHNOLOGY AND MICROBIAL HOST CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING A WIDE RANGE OF UNMET NEEDS IN THERAPEUTICS DEVELOPMENT AND DE-RISK THE USE OF MICROBIAL GMOS FOR CLINICAL TRANSLATION, WITH POTENTIALLY BROAD IMPACT ON DISEASES RANGING FROM AUTOIMMUNE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS TO CANCER. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE LAB OF DR. GEORGE M. CHURCH AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, AND THE PI, DR. AKOS NYERGES, WILL RECEIVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN PROTEOMICS, THE USE OF ANIMAL MODELS, AND HOST-VIRUS INTERACTION ANALYSES DURING THE K99 PHASE FROM AN EXPERT ADVISORY TEAM. THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND THE OUTSTANDING SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT OF HARVARD WILL ENABLE THE PI TO ACHIEVE THE SCIENTIFIC GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL, REACH SCIENTIFIC INDEPENDENCE, AND LAUNCH HIS INDEPENDENT RESEARCH GROUP.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,C,CORRECT AN EXISTING RECORD,B,CONTINUATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_K99EB035165_075/,2024-10-04,2024-10-04

HIGH-RISK HPV (HRHPV) IS A MAJOR TRANSMISSIBLE CAUSE OF CANCERS OF THE ANUS AND OROPHARYNX IN SEXUAL MINORITY MEN (SMM). PREVALENCE OF HRHPV IN SMM IN TANZANIA, EAST AFRICA, A LMIC, IS HIGH AND PROBABLY EPIDEMIC IN ITS LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREA, DAR ES SALAAM. WE PROPOSE TO REPLICATE OUR STUDY TO INVITE AND TRAIN TANZANIAN SMM TO TAKE “SELFIES” OF THE OROPHARYNX AT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH RESOLUTION TO OBSERVE POTENTIAL EARLY LESIONS THAT MAY BE MALIGNANT. THESE “SELFIES” ARE RATED BY AN EXPERT ON OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER FOR SUFFICIENT CLARITY TO DETECT EARLY LESIONS. A GROUP OF 100 SMM WILL BE RECRUITED BY BOTH INTERNET AND RDS SEEDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY, AND ALSO OFFERED A FULL COURSE OF HRHPV VACCINATION. AN INITIAL QUESTIONNAIRE ON KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND SEXUAL PRACTICES WILL BE COMPLETED ON INTERNET AND PARTICIPANTS TRAINED AT A LOCAL NGO TO TAKE ORAL “SELFIES” WHICH ARE UPLOADED TO A FIREWALLED INTERNET SITE FOR AN ENT SPECIALIST TO ASSESS CLARITY. AFTER ENROLLMENT, TWO FURTHER VISITS WILL BE SCHEDULED AT 2 AND 6 MONTHS FOR VACCINATION SHOTS, AND TO ASSESS RETENTION FOR A FUTURE COHORT STUDY.
